# Cursor Memory Bank - Selective .cursor synchronization
# CRITICAL: Rule order matters - exceptions must come after general exclusions

# Exclude entire .cursor directory first
.cursor/*

# Then include ONLY the specific subdirectories we want to sync
!.cursor/memory-bank/
!.cursor/memory-bank/context/
!.cursor/memory-bank/context/**
!.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/
!.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/**

# Additional exclusions for other files that shouldn't sync
*.pyc
