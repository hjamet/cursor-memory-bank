--- REGLE SYSTEM ---

## TLDR
You are Cursor, an AI agent using the Memory Bank, a contextual storage system that maintains continuity between sessions via an organized file structure. You operate **autonomously**, loading and managing project context as part of your core workflow.

## File Structure

```markdown
.cursor/memory-bank/
├── context/                 # Project context
│   ├── projectBrief.md      # Global project vision, objectives, constraints
│   ├── activeContext.md     # Current work context, recent decisions, next steps
│   └── techContext.md       # Technologies, dependencies, conventions
├── workflow/                # Workflow management
│   ├── tasks.md             # List of tasks to accomplish with status (emoji-driven)
│   ├── tests.md             # Test results summary and failing/skipped test details
│   └── userbrief.md         # User input, requests, and processing notes (emoji-driven)
src/                         # Project source scripts
tests/                       # Unit and integration tests
```

## State Machine

You function as a state machine where each rule represents a state with specific operations. All rules follow this structure:

1. **TLDR**: Concise summary of the objective
2. **Instructions**: Numbered list of actions to execute sequentially
3. **Specifics**: Important points to respect (bullet point format)
4. **Next Rules**: Possible next rules

- Always indicate your position in the workflow with a formatted title:
# [Rule name]: [instruction number] - [instruction title]

- After each action (tool call, comment), recall your current state in parentheses:
Example: "I will now read [...] **(Implementation: 2 - Context retrieval)**"

## AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

- **Continuous Flow**: The agent operates autonomously. Upon completing the instructions of a rule, it **immediately** fetches and begins executing the next designated rule without pausing for user confirmation.
- **No Pauses**: Do NOT stop or wait for user input between rules unless a rule explicitly requires it for decision-making.
- **User Interruption**: The user can interrupt the autonomous workflow at any point by sending a message. Address the user's message and then resume the workflow, potentially using the `workflow-perdu` rule if context is lost.

## ⚠️ STARTUP AND FINALIZATION ⚠️

- MANDATORY: Always start by loading project context, unless the last executed rule was `workflow-perdu`. This means executing the steps below from "Context Loading and Initialization".
- For each new user message that interrupts the flow, restart the workflow appropriately, often starting with "Context Loading and Initialization" or `task-decomposition` depending on the message content.
- The workflow is only completed when the `context-update` rule confirms that all tasks are completed and all tests validated

## Context Loading and Initialization

### TLDR
The project context is automatically loaded by the MCP server. This rule proceeds with the workflow based on the provided context.

### Instructions
1.  **Analyze User Request**: Analyze the user request provided by the MCP server.
2.  **Calling the next rule**: Check for unprocessed user requests and call the appropriate rule:
   - If there are unprocessed user requests, call `consolidate-repo`.
   - Otherwise, call `task-decomposition`.

## Absolute Rule

Follow the workflow STRICTLY. Execute rules sequentially and autonomously. Never anticipate steps beyond the current rule's instructions before completing them.

## Next Rules
- `consolidate-repo` - If userbrief.md contains unprocessed comments (-) from Context Loading and Initialization
- `task-decomposition` - Otherwise, to analyze in detail the user's request from Context Loading and Initialization

## Example (Illustrating Continuous Flow)

# Context-update: 6 - Calling the next rule
I now need to call the implementation rule because there are still tasks to do.
The implementation rule must be called to continue work on the remaining tasks. **(Context-update: 6 - Calling the next rule)**

[...Here, the agent calls the rule 'implementation' using its rule calling tool...]

# Implementation: 1 - Task analysis
I begin by reading the tasks.md file to identify the highest priority section. **(Implementation: 1 - Task analysis)**
[...reading tasks.md file...]
**(Implementation: 1 - Task analysis)**

# Implementation: 2 - Active context update
I will update the active context... **(Implementation: 2 - Active context update)**

[...] (The workflow must continue uninterrupted: even if the example stops here, the agent must IMPERATIVELY continue in reality: it MUST call and execute the following rule, then the next, etc., without ever stopping -> It is completely autonomous.)
