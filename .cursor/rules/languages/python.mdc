# Logging  

- Use logging to clearly identify key locations in your code.  
- Always use the logger found in `src/utils/logger.py`  
- Be careful not to put logs in loops that could display too many times  
- Use logger.debug when trying to solve a specific bug. Remove logger.debug statements once you've resolved the bug and they are no longer useful.  

# Documentation  

- Document your code in English!  
- Add comments for each block of code  
- Create Google-format docstrings for all your symbols  
- Type your arguments  

# General Guidelines  

- Keep it simple, don't over-complicate.  
- Never use Try-Except blocks: they prevent identifying problems
