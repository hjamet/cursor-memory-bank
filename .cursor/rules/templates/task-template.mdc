# tasks.md Editing Rules

## TLDR
This file organizes project tasks into logical sections with different priority levels and statuses.

## Limits and Structure

- **Maximum length**: 400 lines
- **Content**: Tasks organized by sections, subsections, and statuses
- **Temporality**: Current tasks, planned tasks, and recently completed tasks

## Mandatory Sections

1. **In Progress**: Tasks currently being executed
2. **ToDo**: Tasks planned but not yet started
3. **Done**: Recently completed tasks

## Complementary Content

- This file focuses on concrete actions to perform
- projectbrief.md contains general objectives
- activeContext.md describes the current work context
- techContext.md details technical aspects

## Reference Template

# In Progress

## 1. [Very High-Level Section]
1.1. [ ] **[Concise Title]**: [Detailed description]
- Actions: [List of actions to perform]
- Files: [List of impacted files]
- Dependencies: [List of tasks this one depends on]
- Validation: [Validation criteria]

1.2. [ ] **[Concise Title]**: [Detailed description]
[...]

## 2. [Very High-Level Section]
2.1. [ ] **[Concise Title]**: [Detailed description]
[...]

# ToDo

## 3. [Very High-Level Section]
3.1. [ ] **[Concise Title]**: [Detailed description]
[...]

# Done

## [Very High-Level Section]
[ x ] **[Concise Title]**: [Brief description]
[ x ] **[Concise Title]**: [Brief description]
[...]

## Style and Best Practices

- **Numbering**: Use consistent numbering (1., 1.1, 2., 2.1)
- **Status**: Use [ ] for incomplete tasks and [x] for completed tasks
- **Detail**: More detailed for "In Progress", less for "Done"
- **Sections**: Maximum 3-4 very high-level sections
- **Dependencies**: Minimize dependencies between tasks
- **Priorities**: Organize by priority/logical sequence

## Validations

- Maximum 3-4 high-level sections
- Tasks grouped by type even if seemingly different
- Comprehensive descriptions rather than multiplication of sections
- Minimization of cross-dependencies
- Completed tasks unrelated to current work removed
