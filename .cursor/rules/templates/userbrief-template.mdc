# userbrief.md Editing Rules

## TLDR
This file contains user requests and preferences, organized in 3 main sections to facilitate tracking and processing.

## Limits and Structure

- **Maximum length**: To be kept as concise as possible without removing content
- **Content**: User requests, preferences, and directives
- **Organization**: Structure in 3 main sections
- **Temporality**: Persistent until the user decides to clear the file

## Format for Sections

- **User Input**: Section where the user can freely write their ideas and thoughts
- **Processing**: Section where requests are moved during their initial processing
- **Precisions**: Section for long-term recommendations and detailed explanations

## Format for Elements

- **â¬œ Todo**: Elements that have not yet been processed
- **ðŸ”„ In Progress**: Elements currently being processed
- **ðŸ“Œ Taken into account**: Persistent preferences to keep (tools, code style, etc.)
- **âœ… Done**: Elements that have been processed and completed

## Reference Template

# User Input
<!-- Users write their new ideas and requests here -->

# Processing
<!-- Requests being processed/transformed into tasks -->
ðŸ”„ [Request being processed]
âœ… [Completed request]

# Precisions
<!-- Long-term preferences and recommendations -->
ðŸ“Œ [Important preference to keep]

## Style and Best Practices

- **Never empty this file**: Only the user can erase the content
- **Reorganization**: Move elements between sections according to their processing status
- **Status updates**: Modify only the status emojis, not the content
- **Conservation**: Elements marked with ðŸ“Œ must be preserved indefinitely
- **Conciseness**: Keep the file as concise as possible without losing information
- **Processed elements**: Mark completed elements with âœ… but leave them in their section

## Validations

- Each element starts with an appropriate status emoji
- Sections are clearly delimited by level 1 headings
- Elements are correctly placed in their respective sections
- The content after the emoji is never modified without explicit directive
- Persistent preferences and requests are marked with ðŸ“Œ
