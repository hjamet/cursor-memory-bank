# userbrief.md Editing Rules

## TLDR
This file contains user requests and preferences, organized in 3 main sections to facilitate tracking and processing.

## Limits and Structure

- **Maximum length**: To be kept as concise as possible without removing content
- **Content**: User requests, preferences, and directives
- **Organization**: Structure in 3 main sections
- **Temporality**: Persistent until the user decides to clear the file

## Format for Sections

- **User Input**: Section where the user can freely write their ideas and thoughts
- **Processing**: Section where requests are moved during their initial processing
- **Precisions**: Section for long-term recommendations and detailed explanations
- **Archives**: Section for requests that have been processed and added to tasks.md

## Format for Elements

- **- Todo**: Elements that have not yet been processed (in "User Input")
- **⏳ In Processing**: Tasks moved from "User Input" by `consolidate-repo`, awaiting decomposition by `task-decomposition`.
- **📌 Preference**: Persistent preferences/directives to keep (in "Precisions").
- **🗄️ Archived**: Tasks moved from "Processing" by `task-decomposition` after being successfully added to `tasks.md`.

## Reference Template

# User Input
<!-- Original user content, processed each cycle. Every input is starting with a hyphen : - -->

# Processing
<!-- Requests being processed/transformed into tasks -->
⏳ [Task awaiting decomposition]

# Precisions
<!-- Long-term preferences and recommendations -->
📌 [Important preference to keep]

# Archives
<!-- Requests that have been processed and added to tasks.md, marked with 🗄️ -->
🗄️ [Archived request]

## Style and Best Practices

- **Never empty this file**: Only the user can erase the content
- **Reorganization**: Move elements between sections according to their processing status
- **Status updates**: Modify only the status emojis, not the content
- **Conservation**: Elements marked with 📌 must be preserved indefinitely
- **Conciseness**: Keep the file as concise as possible without losing information
- **Archived elements**: Elements marked 🗄️ should ideally not be modified by the agent.

## Validations

- Each element starts with an appropriate status emoji
- Sections are clearly delimited by level 1 headings
- Elements are correctly placed in their respective sections
- The content after the emoji is never modified without explicit directive
- Persistent preferences and requests are marked with 📌
