## TLDR
This file documents unit test results, their evolution, and identified issues.

## Limits and Structure

- **Organization**: Tests grouped by status (success, warning, failure)
- **Content**: Detailed results with explanations and evolution
- **Temporality**: Current results with comparison to previous executions

## Mandatory Format

- Successful tests: Prefixed with ✅, concise description and evolution
- Tests with warnings: Prefixed with ⚠️, explanation of the warning and evolution
- Failed tests: Prefixed with ❌, detailed explanation of the failure and evolution
