## TLDR
Update context files to reflect changes, update tasks.md based on test results, and make a commit following conventions.

## Instructions
1. **Context update**: Update the three context files if necessary:
   - `.cursor/memory-bank/context/projectBrief.md`: Update global vision if impacted
   - `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`: Reflect current state after modifications
   - `.cursor/memory-bank/context/techContext.md`: Add/modify technical information if necessary

2. **Context cleanup**: Clean context and workflow files:
   - Remove obsolete or redundant information
   - Condense overly detailed sections
   - Ensure each file remains under 200 lines
   - Prioritize conciseness while maintaining clarity

3. **tasks.md update**: Update `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` based on test results and task completion:
   - Identify tasks that were üü° IN_PROGRESS and are now completed (e.g., based on `activeContext.md` or if the `implementation` rule just finished a task).
   - Change their status emoji from üü° IN_PROGRESS to üü¢ DONE.

4. **Commit changes**: Make a commit with the modifications using the MCP tool:
   - Determine the appropriate `emoji`, `type`, and `title` based on the changes made during the preceding rules.
   - **Construct a detailed `description`**: This description is CRITICAL and must be a comprehensive markdown-formatted text. Refer to the "Format for Detailed Commit Description" section below. It should summarize all work done, tests performed, observations, and a conclusion.
   - Call the `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool with these arguments (`emoji`, `type`, `title`, `description`).
   - The tool handles staging automatically (equivalent to `git add .` or `git commit -a`).

5. **File integrity verification**: Look for structural problems:
   - Read the `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` file.
   - Use the MCP command execution tool via Git Bash to list all markdown files: `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command(command = "\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe\" -c \"find . -type f -name '*.md'\"")`
   - Analyze results to identify:
     - File duplicates
     - Misplaced files
     - Unnecessary temporary files
     - Files with incorrect names
   - If structural problems are identified OR if the `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` file contains unprocessed comments (marked with - symbol in the # User input section), call the `consolidate-repo` rule
   - Otherwise, continue with the next step: 6. **Call the next rule**

6. **Call the next rule**: Mandatory call to the next rule if the workflow is not complete:
   - Read the `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/test.md` file
     - IF at least one test fails, call the `fix` rule
     - ELSE IF structural problems were identified OR if the `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` file contains unprocessed comments (marked with - symbol in the # User input section), call the `consolidate-repo` rule
     - ELSE, check `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` for any tasks marked with üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO emojis.
       - IF yes (tasks still active), call the `implementation` rule
       - ELSE (no üü° or ‚ö™Ô∏è tasks found, meaning all are üü¢ DONE, üî¥ BLOCKED, or üîµ REVIEW), indicate that the workflow is complete.

## Specifics
- Mark tasks as üü¢ DONE only if all associated tests pass and the work for that task is fully completed.
- Use conventional commit format by adding an emoji to describe the operation performed
- Systematically delete old history entries that are no longer relevant
- NEVER end without either explicitly calling a next rule or explicitly indicating that the workflow is complete
- The workflow must NEVER be considered complete if there are remaining tasks with üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO emojis OR if there is at least one failing test (marked ‚ùå) or with warning (marked ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- For the commit, use the `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool, which handles staging automatically.
- If all tasks are complete (meaning there are NO MORE tasks with üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO emojis in the `tasks.md` file) AND all tests pass (ALL marked ‚úÖ), then:
   - Present a clear and concise synthesis of the work done
   - Summarize implemented features and resolved issues
   - Explicitly indicate that the workflow is successfully completed
   - Explicitly state: "The workflow is complete, no next rule to call."
- If the workflow is not complete, call the appropriate next rule

## Format for Detailed Commit Description
The `description` argument for the `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool must be a detailed markdown-formatted string. It serves as a comprehensive record of the work performed. Structure it like a mini-article with the following sections:

```markdown
### Changes Made
*   Detailed bullet point list of all modifications.
*   Be specific: mention file names, functions changed, new features added, bugs fixed.
*   Example:
    *   Modified `src/moduleA/logic.py` to handle edge case X by adding a new validation step.
    *   Created new component `src/components/NewWidget.jsx` for displaying user data.
    *   Refactored `utils/helper.js` for improved performance by optimizing the `calculateValue` function.

### Testing Performed
*   Describe how the changes were tested.
*   Mention specific test scenarios, manual testing steps, or automated tests run.
*   If applicable, include results (e.g., "All 5 new unit tests for `logic.py` passed.").
*   Example:
    *   Manually tested the new widget with various user inputs (empty, long strings, special characters).
    *   Ran the full test suite (`npm test`), all 125 tests passed.
    *   Verified the fix for bug #123 by reproducing the original issue and confirming it's resolved.

### Observations & Learnings
*   Note any interesting observations, challenges encountered, or learnings during the development and testing process.
*   This could include unexpected behaviors, performance insights, or alternative approaches considered.
*   Example:
    *   Observed that the `calculateValue` optimization also reduced memory usage by 10%.
    *   Encountered an issue with library X's compatibility, requiring a workaround (describe briefly).
    *   Learned about a new API feature in Y that could be useful for future tasks.

### Conclusion
*   Provide an overall summary of the work completed and its outcome.
*   State the impact of the changes (e.g., "This resolves critical bug #123 and improves system stability.").
*   Reiterate any key discoveries or insights.
*   Example:
    *   The implementation of the new user data widget is now complete and meets all specified requirements. This feature enhances user experience by providing a clear and interactive way to view their information. The refactoring of `calculateValue` has yielded significant performance gains.
```

**Emoji and Type Reference (for `title`):**
- :sparkles: `feat`: A new feature
- :bug: `fix`: A bug fix
- :memo: `docs`: Documentation only changes
- :recycle: `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- :white_check_mark: `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- :wrench: `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- :art: `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- :zap: `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- :construction: `wip`: Work in progress (use sparingly, prefer complete changes)
- :package: `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- :construction_worker: `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- :rewind: `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Next Rules
- `consolidate-repo` - If file structure problems are detected or unprocessed comments exist in userbrief.md
- `fix` - If at least one test fails
- `implementation` - If at least one task is still in progress or to do and no test fails

## Example

# Context-update: 1 - Context update
I begin by updating the context files to reflect changes. **(Context-update: 1 - Context update)**
[...updating projectBrief.md file...]
**(Context-update: 1 - Context update)**
[...updating activeContext.md file...]
**(Context-update: 1 - Context update)**
[...updating techContext.md file...]
**(Context-update: 1 - Context update)**

# Context-update: 2 - Context cleanup
I clean up context files by removing obsolete information. **(Context-update: 2 - Context cleanup)**
[...cleaning up context files...]
**(Context-update: 2 - Context cleanup)**

# Context-update: 3 - Updating tasks.md file
I update the tasks.md file by changing the status of completed tasks from üü° IN_PROGRESS to üü¢ DONE. **(Context-update: 3 - Updating tasks.md file)**
[...updating tasks.md file...]
**(Context-update: 3 - Updating tasks.md file)**

# Context-update: 4 - Making a commit
I prepare and make a commit with the changes made using the MCP commit tool. **(Context-update: 4 - Making a commit)**
<think>
To construct the commit message, I need to determine:
1.  `emoji` and `type`: Based on the overall nature of the changes (e.g., :sparkles: feat, :bug: fix).
2.  `title`: A concise summary of the changes.
3.  `description`: This needs to be very detailed, following the new markdown format. I will need to synthesize information from `activeContext.md`, possibly `projectBrief.md`, `tasks.md` (for what was planned), and `tests.md` (for test results) to fill in:
    *   `### Changes Made`: What code/files were altered? What was the specific change?
    *   `### Testing Performed`: How was it tested? What were the results?
    *   `### Observations & Learnings`: Any notable points during the process?
    *   `### Conclusion`: Overall summary and impact.
This requires gathering and structuring a lot of information.

[...gathering information and constructing the detailed emoji, type, title, and multi-section markdown description...]\
[...calling tool `mcp_MyMCP_commit` with appropriate arguments, including the detailed markdown description...]\
**(Context-update: 4 - Making a commit)**

# Context-update: 5 - File integrity verification
I now check the integrity of project files using the MCP command execution tool via Git Bash. **(Context-update: 5 - File integrity verification)**
[...calling tool `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` with command="\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe\" -c \"find . -type f -name '*.md'\""...]
[...analyzing command results...]\nI have not identified structural problems in the files. I will now check the content of the `userbrief.md` file. **(Context-update: 5 - File integrity verification)**
[...checking .cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md file...]
I don't see new tasks or advice to process. I will therefore proceed to the next step.
**(Context-update: 5 - File integrity verification)**

# Context-update: 6 - Calling the next rule
I now check the tests and remaining tasks (looking for üü° or ‚ö™Ô∏è emojis) to determine which rule to call. **(Context-update: 6 - Calling the next rule)**
[...checking tests and tasks...]
I see there are tasks with üü° or ‚ö™Ô∏è emojis and all tests pass. I will therefore call the `implementation` rule. **(Context-update: 6 - Calling the next rule)**

[...] (The workflow must continue uninterrupted: even if the example stops here, the agent must IMPERATIVELY continue in reality: it MUST call and execute the following rule, then the next, etc., without ever stopping -> It is completely autonomous.)
