## TLDR
Analyzes user requests, explores existing code, searches for additional information, retrieves high-level context, stores relevant vision elements, and decomposes requests into concrete tasks organized in `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` using an emoji-based status system.

## Instructions

1. **Request analysis**: Understand the user's request:
   - Analyze direct request or request transmitted by calling rule
   - Identify requested features or modifications
   - Extract important keywords and concepts
   - **High-Level Context Retrieval**: Use `codebase_search` targeting the `.cursor_memory` directory with keywords from the request to find relevant high-level vision or context notes.
   - **Vision Storage**: If the user expresses high-level goals, preferences, or vision elements ("I want the app to...", "The overall goal is...", "I prefer bright colors..."), create a concise Markdown note summarizing this point and save it in the `.cursor_memory` directory using `edit_file`. Choose a descriptive filename (e.g., `user_preference_color_palette.md`, `project_goal_user_auth.md`).

2. **Code analysis**: Identify concerned files and symbols:
   - ONLY AUTHORIZED: up to 3 semantic searches (code base search) based on request keywords
   - OPTIONALLY AUTHORIZED: tree command to visualize directory structure
   - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: listing folders/files, reading specific files, or using any other tool
   - Don't limit to files explicitly mentioned in the request
   - Add brief descriptions for each important element

3. **Additional research**: Consult documentation and resources:
   - Research library documentation, patterns, or relevant best practices.
   - PREFERRED for external library documentation (especially less common ones): Use `mcp_Context7_resolve-library-id` then `mcp_Context7_get-library-docs` for structured docs and examples.
   - ALTERNATIVE/General research: Use the `mcp_brave-search_brave_web_search` tool, limited to 5 searches maximum.
   - Note consulted sources.

4. **Existing tasks analysis**:
    - Read the `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` file if it exists.

5. **Userbrief processing identification**: Consult the userbrief via the MCP tool.
    - Call `mcp_MemoryBank_read-userbrief` to get the currently active request.
    - Identify if there is a `current_request` with status `'in_progress'`.
    - Prepare this identified request for transformation into structured tasks for `tasks.md` in step 7.

6. **Completed tasks archival/removal**:
    - Identify completed tasks (üü¢ DONE) that are very old and could be archived or deleted because they are no longer relevant to the current focus.
    - Remove these outdated `üü¢ DONE` tasks from `tasks.md`.

7. **New tasks integration**: Structure new tasks in `tasks.md`.
    - Integrate the main request (from the calling rule or active context) AND any requests identified in step 5 (marked with ‚è≥ in `userbrief.md` AND ONLY THEM).
    - Add new tasks/sub-tasks starting with the `‚ö™Ô∏è TODO` emoji.
    - Follow the **Task Item Structure** defined below for each task:
        *   Emoji (‚ö™Ô∏è) and Bold Title (with numbering like **1.** or **1.1.**)
        *   Detailed `Description`
        *   `Impacted Rules/Files`
        *   `Dependencies`
        *   `Validation` criteria.
    - New tasks should be added logically, typically after existing üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO tasks, and before any archived/very old üü¢ DONE tasks.
    - Prioritize by importance, dependencies, impact, and complexity when ordering new tasks amongst themselves.

8. **Userbrief archiving**: Update the processed request via the MCP tool.
    - For EACH request identified in Step 5 that was successfully integrated into `tasks.md` in Step 7:
        - Call `mcp_MemoryBank_update-userbrief` with the following parameters:
            - `action: 'mark_archived'`
            - `id`: The ID of the request being processed.
            - `comment`: "Task decomposed and added to tasks.md."
    - IMPORTANT: Only process items identified in Step 5.

9. **Call next rule**: Mandatory call to `implementation`.

## Specifics
- If you were called from consolidate-repo, consider the formulated request as the user request to analyze
- If the brief is empty without explicit request, consider tasks.md content as request
- Strict tool limits:
  - Phase 2 (Code analysis): only code base search (max 3) and tree
  - Phase 3 (Research): only mcp_Context7_* tools OR `mcp_brave-search_brave_web_search` (max 5 searches)
- Never mention planned modifications to context files (.cursor/memory-bank/* or .cursor/memory/*) unless creating a new vision note.
- Group similar tasks under common main task structures, even if apparently different.
- Favor detailed descriptions for each task item.
- Minimize dependencies between major tasks where possible.
- IMPORTANT: Do not add new tasks to `userbrief.md`.
- IMPORTANT: Crucially, NEVER archive a request (Step 8) if its corresponding task(s) were NOT successfully added to `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` in Step 7.
- IMPORTANT: Only process the active request identified by the `read-userbrief` tool.

## tasks.md: New Format Definition

The `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` file no longer uses H1/H2 section titles (e.g., `# In Progress`, `# ToDo`). It is a flat list of task items, each starting with an emoji indicating its status. This rule (`task-decomposition`) is primarily responsible for creating new tasks (usually with ‚ö™Ô∏è) and structuring them.

**Emoji Legend & Handling by `task-decomposition`:**
*   `‚ö™Ô∏è TODO`: For new tasks or sub-tasks. This rule will primarily add tasks with this emoji.
*   `üü° IN_PROGRESS`: Tasks currently being worked on (status set by `implementation` or `context-update` rules).
*   `üü¢ DONE`: Completed tasks (status set by `implementation` or `context-update` rules).
*   `üî¥ BLOCKED`: Tasks that cannot proceed.
*   `üîµ REVIEW`: Tasks awaiting review.

**Task Item Structure:**
Each task, regardless of status, should generally follow this structure:
```markdown
[EMOJI] **[Concise Title - Main Task or Sub-Task Numbering, e.g., 1. or 1.1]**
    *   **Description**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be done.]
    *   **Impacted Rules/Files**: [List of rules or files affected by this task.]
    *   **Dependencies**: [List of other tasks this one depends on, if any. Use task numbers if available.]
    *   **Validation**: [Clear criteria to determine when the task is successfully completed.]
```
- Main tasks can be numbered (e.g., `‚ö™Ô∏è **1. Main Task Title**`).
- Sub-tasks should be indented and can use sub-numbering (e.g., `    *   ‚ö™Ô∏è **1.1. Sub-Task Title**`).
- The `---` separator can be used to visually group related sets of tasks if helpful, but is not structurally mandatory.

## Next Rules
- `implementation` - To begin implementing tasks.

*I search for existing high-level context notes related to these keywords in `.cursor_memory`.*
`codebase_search(query='...', target_directories=['.cursor/memory'])`
*If the user stated a new high-level vision element like 'The UI should feel modern and clean', I create a note:*
`edit_file(target_file='.cursor/memory/ui_vision_modern_clean.md', code_edit='The user wants a modern and clean UI.', instructions='Create new vision note.')`
**(Task-decomposition: 1 - Request analysis)**

I now consult the userbrief via the MCP tool to identify the active task. **(Task-decomposition: 5 - Userbrief processing identification)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.mcp_MemoryBank_read_userbrief()) ...
I identified the active request. I will prepare it for integration into `tasks.md` in step 7.
**(Task-decomposition: 5 - Userbrief processing identification)**

# Task-decomposition: 8 - Userbrief archiving
Now that the tasks from the userbrief have been integrated into `tasks.md`, I will ensure the original request is archived using the MCP tool. **(Task-decomposition: 8 - Userbrief archiving)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.mcp_MemoryBank_update_userbrief(action='mark_archived', id=request_id, comment='Task decomposed and added to tasks.md.')) ...
**(Task-decomposition: 8 - Userbrief archiving)**

# Task-decomposition: 9 - Call next rule
I must now call the `implementation` rule to begin work on the newly structured tasks.
The `implementation` rule must be called to begin implementing the tasks. **(Task-decomposition: 9 - Call next rule)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.fetch_rules(rule_names=["implementation"])) ...
