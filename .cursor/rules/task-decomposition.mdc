## TLDR
Decomposes user requests into concrete tasks and organizes them in `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` using an emoji-based status system.

## Instructions

1.  **Existing tasks analysis**:
    - Read the `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` file if it exists.

2.  **Userbrief processing identification**: Consult the `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` file.
    - Identify requests marked with  (AND ONLY THEM). (This assumes `consolidate-repo.mdc` has marked them).
    - Prepare these identified requests for transformation into structured tasks for `tasks.md` in step 4.
    - IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify `userbrief.md` at this stage.

3.  **Completed tasks archival/removal**:
    - Identify completed tasks (🟢 DONE) that are very old and could be archived or deleted because they are no longer relevant to the current focus.
    - Remove these outdated `🟢 DONE` tasks from `tasks.md`.

4.  **New tasks integration**: Structure new tasks in `tasks.md`.
    - Integrate the main request (from the calling rule or active context) AND any requests identified in step 2 (marked with ⏳ in `userbrief.md` AND ONLY THEM).
    - Add new tasks/sub-tasks starting with the `⚪️ TODO` emoji.
    - Follow the **Task Item Structure** defined above for each task:
        *   Emoji (⚪️) and Bold Title (with numbering like **1.** or **1.1.**)
        *   Detailed `Description`
        *   `Impacted Rules/Files`
        *   `Dependencies`
        *   `Validation` criteria.
    - New tasks should be added logically, typically after existing 🟡 IN_PROGRESS or ⚪️ TODO tasks, and before any archived/very old 🟢 DONE tasks.
    - Prioritize by importance, dependencies, impact, and complexity when ordering new tasks amongst themselves.

5.  **Userbrief archiving**: Update `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`.
    - For EACH request identified in Step 2 (marked with ⏳) that was successfully integrated into `tasks.md` in Step 4:
        - Mark this request as processed by removing its "processing" emoji (⏳) and replacing it with an "archive" emoji (🗄️).
    - IMPORTANT: Only modify items which were marked with ⏳ in `userbrief.md` and that were successfully added to `tasks.md` in Step 4.

6.  **Call next rule**: Mandatory call to `implementation`.

## Specifics
- Group similar tasks under common main task structures, even if apparently different.
- Favor detailed descriptions for each task item.
- Minimize dependencies between major tasks where possible.
- IMPORTANT: Do not add new tasks to `userbrief.md`.
- IMPORTANT: Crucially, NEVER archive an item in `userbrief.md` (Step 5) if its corresponding task(s) were NOT successfully added to `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` in Step 4.
- IMPORTANT: Only process items marked with ⏳ in `userbrief.md`. Never process items marked with other emojis or even simple "-".

## tasks.md: New Format Definition

The `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` file no longer uses H1/H2 section titles (e.g., `# In Progress`, `# ToDo`). It is a flat list of task items, each starting with an emoji indicating its status. This rule (`task-decomposition`) is primarily responsible for creating new tasks (usually with ⚪️) and structuring them.

**Emoji Legend & Handling by `task-decomposition`:**
*   `⚪️ TODO`: For new tasks or sub-tasks. This rule will primarily add tasks with this emoji.
*   `🟡 IN_PROGRESS`: Tasks currently being worked on (status set by `implementation` or `context-update` rules).
*   `🟢 DONE`: Completed tasks (status set by `implementation` or `context-update` rules).
*   `🔴 BLOCKED`: Tasks that cannot proceed.
*   `🔵 REVIEW`: Tasks awaiting review.

**Task Item Structure:**
Each task, regardless of status, should generally follow this structure:
```markdown
[EMOJI] **[Concise Title - Main Task or Sub-Task Numbering, e.g., 1. or 1.1]**
    *   **Description**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be done.]
    *   **Impacted Rules/Files**: [List of rules or files affected by this task.]
    *   **Dependencies**: [List of other tasks this one depends on, if any. Use task numbers if available.]
    *   **Validation**: [Clear criteria to determine when the task is successfully completed.]
```
- Main tasks can be numbered (e.g., `⚪️ **1. Main Task Title**`).
- Sub-tasks should be indented and can use sub-numbering (e.g., `    *   ⚪️ **1.1. Sub-Task Title**`).
- The `---` separator can be used to visually group related sets of tasks if helpful, but is not structurally mandatory.

## Next Rules
- `implementation` - To begin implementing tasks.

## Example

# Task-decomposition: 1 - Existing tasks analysis
I begin by reading the `tasks.md` file to understand the current state of tasks using the emoji-based format. **(Task-decomposition: 1 - Existing tasks analysis)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.read_file(target_file=".cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md")) ...
**(Task-decomposition: 1 - Existing tasks analysis)**

# Task-decomposition: 2 - Userbrief processing identification
I now consult the `userbrief.md` file to identify tasks marked with ⏳. **(Task-decomposition: 2 - Userbrief processing identification)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.read_file(target_file=".cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md")) ...
I identified several items marked with ⏳. I will prepare them for integration into `tasks.md` in step 4.
**(Task-decomposition: 2 - Userbrief processing identification)**

# Task-decomposition: 3 - Completed tasks archival/removal
The tasks X, Y, and Z are marked as 🟢 DONE aren't linked to our current focus. I will remove them from `tasks.md` to keep it clean and relevant. **
**(Task-decomposition: 3 - Completed tasks archival/removal)**

# Task-decomposition: 4 - New tasks integration
I decompose the main request and the identified ⏳ userbrief items into concrete tasks in `tasks.md`, using the new emoji-based format. **(Task-decomposition: 4 - New tasks integration)**
```json
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.edit_file(target_file=".cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md", code_edit=\'\'\'
// ... existing tasks ...
⚪️ **3. New Main Task from Request**
    *   **Description**: [Detailed description of the new main task based on the original user request or active context.]
    *   **Impacted Rules/Files**: [List relevant files/rules.]
    *   **Dependencies**: [List dependencies.]
    *   **Validation**: [Define validation criteria.]

⚪️ **4. Task from Userbrief Item 1**
    *   **Description**: [Description based on the ⏳ userbrief item.]
    *   **Impacted Rules/Files**: [files/rules.]
    *   **Dependencies**: [dependencies.]
    *   **Validation**: [validation criteria.]
    *   **Sub-Tasks**:
        *   ⚪️ **4.1. Sub-task for Userbrief Item 1**
            *   **Description**: [Detailed sub-task description.]
            *   **Impacted Rules/Files**: [files/rules.]
            *   **Dependencies**: [dependencies.]
            *   **Validation**: [validation criteria.]
\'\'\')) ...
```
**(Task-decomposition: 4 - New tasks integration)**

# Task-decomposition: 5 - Userbrief archiving
Now that the tasks from userbrief have been integrated into `tasks.md`, I will ensure the original items in `userbrief.md` are updated from ⏳ to 🗄️. **(Task-decomposition: 5 - Userbrief archiving)**
// ... tool_code to modify userbrief.md ...
**(Task-decomposition: 5 - Userbrief archiving)**

# Task-decomposition: 6 - Call next rule
I must now call the `implementation` rule to begin work on the newly structured tasks.
The `implementation` rule must be called to begin implementing the tasks. **(Task-decomposition: 6 - Call next rule)**
// ... tool_code: print(default_api.fetch_rules(rule_names=["implementation"])) ...

[...] (The workflow must continue uninterrupted)
