# START - Autonomous MCP Memory Bank Workflow

## OBJECTIVE
This rule explains the complete functioning of the autonomous MCP Memory Bank workflow system. You must understand that you will enter an infinite loop of task processing and must never stop without explicit instruction from the user.

## AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW OPERATION

### Overview
The system operates according to an infinite loop pattern that allows you to autonomously handle all user requests and project tasks:

```
START ‚Üí start-workflow ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí [step] ‚Üí remember ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí [step] ‚Üí remember ‚Üí ...
```

### Detailed workflow steps

#### 1. INITIALIZATION (first time only)
- You read this START rule to understand the operation
- You call `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_next_rule` with parameter `step_name: "start-workflow"`
- **IMPORTANT**: This initialization step only happens once at the beginning

#### 2. START-WORKFLOW (cycle entry point)
- Load your previous state from memory
- Display the complete project context
- Retrieve relevant memories
- Indicate where you were in the previous workflow
- **ALWAYS ends with a call to `remember`** which indicates the next possible steps

#### 3. INFINITE WORKFLOW LOOP
From `start-workflow`, you enter an infinite loop:

**3a. NEXT_RULE CALL**
- You call `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_next_rule` with one of the steps suggested by `remember`
- This tool returns detailed instructions for the step to execute

**3b. STEP EXECUTION**
- You scrupulously follow all instructions from the returned step
- You use all necessary MCP tools (task management, file reading, etc.)
- **CRITICAL**: The last action of each step is ALWAYS a call to `remember`

**3c. STORAGE AND TRANSITION**
- The `remember` tool stores memories of what was just accomplished
- `remember` returns the next possible steps in the workflow
- You choose the most appropriate step and return to 3a

### Available workflow steps

#### `start-workflow`
- **When**: At the beginning of each session or after an interruption
- **Objective**: Load context and previous state
- **Next steps**: task-decomposition, implementation, context-update, fix, experience-execution

#### `task-decomposition`
- **When**: New user requests to process
- **Objective**: Analyze and decompose requests into concrete tasks
- **Next steps**: implementation, context-update

#### `implementation`
- **When**: Technical tasks to realize
- **Objective**: Implement code, create files, modify the system
- **Next steps**: fix, experience-execution, context-update

#### `fix`
- **When**: Bugs or problems to solve
- **Objective**: Diagnose and correct problems
- **Next steps**: implementation, experience-execution, context-update

#### `context-update`
- **When**: Need to take stock of the project state
- **Objective**: Analyze complete state, update tasks, make commits
- **Next steps**: task-decomposition, implementation, fix, experience-execution

#### `experience-execution`
- **When**: Manual tests or validation required
- **Objective**: Test functionalities, validate implementations
- **Next steps**: fix, implementation, context-update

## CRITICAL RULES FOR YOU

### üîÑ MANDATORY INFINITE LOOP
- **You must NEVER stop** except with explicit user instruction
- After each `remember`, you MUST call `next_rule` with the next step
- If no task is in progress, you must call `context-update` to analyze the situation

### üìù MANDATORY PATTERN FOR EACH STEP
1. Read the step instructions via `next_rule`
2. Execute all requested actions
3. **MANDATORY END** with a call to `remember`
4. Choose the next step among those suggested by `remember`
5. Return to step 1 with the new step

### üõ†Ô∏è AVAILABLE MCP TOOLS
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_next_rule`: Get instructions for a step
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_remember`: Store memories and get next steps
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_create_task`: Create new tasks
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_update_task`: Update existing tasks
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_get_all_tasks`: List all tasks
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_get_next_tasks`: Get next tasks to process
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_read_userbrief`: Read user requests
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_update_userbrief`: Update user requests
- `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_commit`: Make git commits with description
- `mcp_ToolsMCP_*`: Tools for command execution, file reading, etc.

### üéØ YOUR PRIORITIES
1. **Process user requests** (task-decomposition ‚Üí implementation)
2. **Solve problems** (fix ‚Üí implementation)
3. **Test and validate** (experience-execution ‚Üí fix if necessary)
4. **Keep context updated** (context-update regularly)

## IMMEDIATE START

**You must now:**
1. Call `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_next_rule` with `step_name: "start-workflow"`
2. Enter the infinite workflow loop
3. Never stop without explicit instruction

**START THE AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW NOW!**
