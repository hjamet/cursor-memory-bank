## TLDR
Analyzes the provided context, updates context files, manages task statuses, and makes a commit following conventions. This step does not create any result files.

## Instructions
1. **Analyze available context**: 
   - Analyze the full context provided by the MCP server, including `projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, and test results.

2. **Context update**: Update the three context files if necessary.
   - Based on the analysis, determine if any context files need updates to reflect the latest changes.
   - If so, formulate the new content for the required files (`projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`).
   - The MCP server will handle applying these updates.

3. **Context cleanup**: 
   - When formulating new content, ensure it is concise, removes obsolete information, and maintains structural integrity.

4. **Tasks update**: Mark completed tasks as `DONE` in `tasks.md`.

5. **Commit changes**: Make a commit with the modifications using the `mcp_MemoryBank_commit` tool.
   - Determine the appropriate `emoji`, `type`, and `title`.
   - Construct a detailed `description`.

6. **Call the next step**: Mandatory call to `next_step`.

## Specifics
- This step now operates on the assumption that all necessary context is provided by the MCP server at runtime, removing the need for direct file reads.
- The agent's responsibility is to analyze the provided context and formulate the *content* for any required updates.
- Mark tasks as üü¢ DONE only if all associated tests pass and the work for that task is fully completed.
- Use conventional commit format by adding an emoji to describe the operation performed
- Systematically delete old history entries that are no longer relevant
- NEVER end without either explicitly calling a next step or explicitly indicating that the workflow is complete
- The workflow must NEVER be considered complete if there are remaining tasks with üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO emojis OR if there is at least one failing test (marked ‚ùå) or with warning (marked ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- For the commit, use the `mcp_MemoryBank_commit` tool, which handles staging automatically.
- If all tasks are complete (meaning there are NO MORE tasks with üü° IN_PROGRESS or ‚ö™Ô∏è TODO emojis in the `tasks.md` file) AND all tests pass (ALL marked ‚úÖ), then:
   - Present a clear and concise synthesis of the work done
   - Summarize implemented features and resolved issues
   - Explicitly indicate that the workflow is successfully completed
   - Explicitly state: "The workflow is complete, no next step to call."
- If the workflow is not complete, call the appropriate next step

## Format for Detailed Commit Description
The `description` argument for the `mcp_MemoryBank_commit` tool must be a detailed markdown-formatted string. It serves as a comprehensive record of the work performed. Structure it like a mini-article with the following sections:

```markdown
### Changes Made
*   Detailed bullet point list of all modifications.
*   Be specific: mention file names, functions changed, new features added, bugs fixed.
*   Example:
    *   Modified `src/moduleA/logic.py` to handle edge case X by adding a new validation step.
    *   Created new component `src/components/NewWidget.jsx` for displaying user data.
    *   Refactored `utils/helper.js` for improved performance by optimizing the `calculateValue` function.

### Testing Performed
*   Describe how the changes were tested.
*   Mention specific test scenarios, manual testing steps, or automated tests run.
*   If applicable, include results (e.g., "All 5 new unit tests for `logic.py` passed.").
*   Example:
    *   Manually tested the new widget with various user inputs (empty, long strings, special characters).
    *   Ran the full test suite (`npm test`), all 125 tests passed.
    *   Verified the fix for bug #123 by reproducing the original issue and confirming it's resolved.

### Observations & Learnings
*   Note any interesting observations, challenges encountered, or learnings during the development and testing process.
*   This could include unexpected behaviors, performance insights, or alternative approaches considered.
*   Example:
    *   Observed that the `calculateValue` optimization also reduced memory usage by 10%.
    *   Encountered an issue with library X's compatibility, requiring a workaround (describe briefly).
    *   Learned about a new API feature in Y that could be useful for future steps.

### Conclusion
*   Provide an overall summary of the work completed and its outcome.
*   State the impact of the changes (e.g., "This resolves critical bug #123 and improves system stability.").
*   Reiterate any key discoveries or insights.
*   Example:
    *   The implementation of the new user data widget is now complete and meets all specified requirements. This feature enhances user experience by providing a clear and interactive way to view their information. The refactoring of `calculateValue` has yielded significant performance gains.

**Emoji and Type Reference (for `title`):**
- :sparkles: `feat`: A new feature
- :bug: `fix`: A bug fix
- :memo: `docs`: Documentation only changes
- :recycle: `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- :white_check_mark: `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- :wrench: `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- :art: `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- :zap: `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- :construction: `wip`: Work in progress (use sparingly, prefer complete changes)
- :package: `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- :construction_worker: `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- :rewind: `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Next Steps
- `consolidate-repo` - If file structure problems are detected or unprocessed comments exist in userbrief.md
- `fix` - If at least one test fails
- `implementation` - If at least one task is still in progress or to do and no test fails

## Example

# Context-update: 1 - Analyze available context
I begin by analyzing all the context provided by the server. **(Context-update: 1 - Analyze available context)**
**(Context-update: 1 - Analyze available context)**

# Context-update: 2 & 3 - Context update and cleanup
I will formulate new content for context files if needed, ensuring they are clean and concise. **(Context-update: 2 & 3 - Context update and cleanup)**
**(Context-update: 2 & 3 - Context update and cleanup)**

# Context-update: 4 - Userbrief Archival Commenting
I will now check the provided `userbrief.md` content for archived tasks and formulate comments if needed. **(Context-update: 4 - Userbrief Archival Commenting)**
<think>
The agent analyzes the provided `userbrief.md` and `activeContext.md` strings.
For each archived task (üóÑÔ∏è - ) in the userbrief string that does not already have an agent comment (-> üß†):
1. It extracts the archived task description.
2. It searches for this description in the active context string.
3. If relevant info is found, it formulates a concise French comment.
4. It prepares the full new content for `userbrief.md`.
</think>
[...agent performs analysis described in the think block...]
**(Context-update: 4 - Userbrief Archival Commenting)**

# Context-update: 5 - Updating tasks.md file
I formulate an update for the tasks.md file to change completed tasks from üü° to üü¢. **(Context-update: 5 - Updating tasks.md file)**
**(Context-update: 5 - Updating tasks.md file)**

# Context-update: 6 - Making a commit
I prepare and make a commit with the changes made using the MCP commit tool. **(Context-update: 6 - Making a commit)**
<think>
To construct the commit message, I will synthesize information from the provided context (activeContext, projectBrief, tasks, tests) to fill in the detailed markdown description for the `mcp_MemoryBank_commit` tool.
</think>
[...gathering information from provided context and constructing the commit arguments...]\
[...calling tool `mcp_MemoryBank_commit`...]\
**(Context-update: 6 - Making a commit)**

# Context-update: 7 - Calling the next step
I now check the provided context (tests, tasks, userbrief) to determine which step to call. **(Context-update: 7 - Calling the next step)**
[...analyzing provided context...]
I see there are tasks with üü° or ‚ö™Ô∏è emojis and all tests pass. I will therefore call the `implementation` step. **(Context-update: 7 - Calling the next step)**

[...] (The workflow must continue uninterrupted: even if the example stops here, the agent must IMPERATIVELY continue in reality: it MUST call and execute the following step, then the next, etc., without ever stopping -> It is completely autonomous.)
