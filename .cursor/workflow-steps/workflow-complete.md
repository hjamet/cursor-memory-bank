## TLDR
The workflow is complete. All tasks have been processed, and there are no new user requests. Inform the user and enter an idle state.

## Instructions

1.  **Inform the User**:
    -   Call `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_remember`.
    -   Use the `user_message` parameter to send a final message to the user.
    -   The message should clearly state that all tasks are finished and the agent is now idle, awaiting further instructions. Example: "All tasks are complete. I am now idle and waiting for new requests."

2.  **Stop the Workflow**:
    -   Do not call `mcp_MemoryBankMCP_next_rule`.
    -   By not calling the next rule, the autonomous loop will naturally stop.
    -   This is the designated final step of the workflow.
