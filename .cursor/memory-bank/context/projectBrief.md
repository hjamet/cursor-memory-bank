# Project Brief

## Vision
Create a production-ready autonomous AI agent operating within Cursor IDE that can reliably manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain persistent context across coding sessions without human supervision.

## Core Mission
The agent assists user `hjamet` by autonomously:
- Breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks
- Implementing solutions with appropriate validation and testing
- Maintaining project health through continuous monitoring and cleanup
- Learning from interactions to improve future performance

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Autonomous Workflow Engine**: Infinite loop system (`start-workflow ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí execute ‚Üí remember`) with intelligent step routing
- **Persistent Memory Bank**: JSON-based storage (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`) with semantic search and long-term memory
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring, request submission, and progress tracking
- **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for system integration

### Key Capabilities
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation, dependency tracking, and automatic status transitions
- **Request Processing**: User request intake, analysis, decomposition into actionable tasks
- **Code Operations**: File manipulation, git operations, terminal command execution
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup, semantic search, context preservation

## Current Status: PRODUCTION ACTIVE

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements (2025-07-02)
- **Critical Security Fix**: Repository cleaned from 1,203 unwanted tracked files (99.9% reduction)
- **Git Performance Restored**: Repository size normalized, git operations now instantaneous
- **Selective Synchronization**: Only `.cursor/memory-bank/context/` and `workflow/` are Git-tracked
- **Data Integrity Systems**: Duplicate detection, circular dependency prevention, and centralized CRUD validation are ACTIVE and operational
- **Workflow Stability**: Autonomous workflow operates reliably with intelligent routing and loop prevention
- **User Interface**: Complete Streamlit interface with real-time monitoring and interaction capabilities
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent storage with automatic cleanup and semantic search
- **Validation Architecture**: 3-layer validation system (Schema ‚Üí Business Rules ‚Üí Data Integrity) fully operational
- **MCP Tool Reliability**: `replace_content_between` tool successfully corrected and validated post-MCP restart
- **Workflow Rule Optimization**: Task-decomposition rule simplified from "skeptical" to "methodical" approach with multi-task capability
- **Installation Script Fixed**: Critical bug in install.sh resolved (Request #239) - new installations now work correctly

### üîß Active Maintenance Areas
- **CURRENT: Streamlit Interface Bug**: Task #292 - Corriger les cl√©s dupliqu√©es Streamlit (TODO - HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Cross-platform Testing**: New gitignore rules need validation on different operating systems
- **Statistical Monitoring**: Task counters occasionally show inconsistencies (non-critical)
- **Error Message Refinement**: Zod validation errors could provide cleaner user feedback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Constraints
- **MCP Server Deployment**: Modifications to MCP tool code require manual Cursor restart (architectural limitation)
- **Tool Reliability**: Some editing tools (`edit_file`) are unreliable for complex operations; workarounds exist
- **Debug Limitations**: MCP tools cannot use console.log without breaking JSON-RPC communication
- **Streamlit Key Management**: Element key generation must ensure uniqueness across all UI components

- **Security Exposure**: Eliminated by selective synchronization
- **MCP Tool Failures**: `replace_content_between` tool corrected and validated
- **Workflow Rule Conflicts**: Task-decomposition rule successfully simplified and optimized
- **Installation Script Failure**: Fixed critical bug in manage_gitignore function (Request #239 RESOLVED)

### CURRENT RISK (NEW)
- **Streamlit Interface Stability**: Task #292 - Duplicate element key errors affecting user interface
  - **Impact**: Interface crashes when multiple requests displayed simultaneously in other repositories
  - **Urgency**: HIGH PRIORITY - affects user experience across multiple deployments
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust key generation logic in task_rendering.py
  - **Status**: Task created and ready for implementation

### LOW RISK
- **System crashes or data loss**: Robust error handling and backup systems in place
- **Feature regression**: Comprehensive validation prevents breaking changes

### MEDIUM RISK
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Gitignore rules untested on all platforms (mitigation: testing planned)
- **Development friction**: MCP restart requirement slows iterative development (mitigation: batch changes)

### ACCEPTABLE RISK
- **Statistical inconsistencies**: Non-critical monitoring issues that don't affect core functionality
- **Tool workarounds**: Some tools require alternatives but functionality is preserved

## Strategic Direction

### Immediate (This Week) - CURRENT
- **PRIORITY 1**: Implement Task #292 - Fix Streamlit duplicate key bug in task_rendering.py
- **PRIORITY 2**: Cross-platform testing of corrected installation scripts
- **PRIORITY 3**: Performance monitoring of validation systems

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Cross-platform testing of installation scripts
- Enhanced error reporting in installation process
- Performance testing of validation systems
- Test infrastructure implementation (addressing critical gap identified in task #273)

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- Enhanced error messaging and user experience
- Advanced workflow features (parallel task processing, smart dependency resolution)
- Database migration planning (SQLite replacement for JSON files)

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Multi-user support and role-based access
- Integration with additional development tools
- Machine learning improvements for request understanding and task optimization

## Critical Lessons Learned

### Git Synchronization Complexity (ONGOING ISSUE)
- **Problem**: Gitignore exception syntax is fragile and order-dependent
- **Solution**: Explicit inclusion rules with thorough testing
- **Prevention**: Always validate gitignore rules with proper testing
- **NEW DISCOVERY**: Manual fixes may not be reflected in installation scripts

### MCP Tool Development Best Practices (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent path resolution patterns across MCP tools
- **Solution**: Standardized path resolution using `path.join(projectRoot, target_file)`
- **Prevention**: Always align new tools with established patterns from stable tools
- **Validation**: MCP server restart required for tool code changes to take effect

### System Resilience Validation (PROVEN)
- **Achievement**: System successfully identified, analyzed, and resolved critical infrastructure issues autonomously
- **Learning**: Robust validation systems and comprehensive logging enable effective self-correction
- **Future**: Continue building on proven architectural patterns for reliability

### Installation Consistency Challenge (NEW)
- **Problem**: Discrepancy between manual system fixes and automated installation scripts
- **Impact**: New deployments fail despite working systems
- **Learning**: Installation scripts must be continuously synchronized with manual improvements
- **Action Required**: Establish process for installation script validation after manual fixes
