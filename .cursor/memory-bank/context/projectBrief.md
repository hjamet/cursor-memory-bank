# Project Brief

## Vision
Create a production-ready autonomous AI agent operating within Cursor IDE that can reliably manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain persistent context across coding sessions without human supervision.

## Core Mission
The agent assists user `hjamet` by autonomously:
- Breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks
- Implementing solutions with appropriate validation and testing
- Maintaining project health through continuous monitoring and cleanup
- Learning from interactions to improve future performance

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Autonomous Workflow Engine**: Infinite loop system (`start-workflow ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí execute ‚Üí remember`) with intelligent step routing
- **Persistent Memory Bank**: JSON-based storage (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`) with semantic search and long-term memory
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring, request submission, and progress tracking
- **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for system integration

### Key Capabilities
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation, dependency tracking, and automatic status transitions
- **Request Processing**: User request intake, analysis, decomposition into actionable tasks
- **Code Operations**: File manipulation, git operations, terminal command execution
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup, semantic search, context preservation

## Current Status: PRODUCTION ACTIVE WITH RECENT CRITICAL FIXES

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements (2025-07-01)
- **Critical Security Fix**: Repository cleaned from 1,203 unwanted tracked files (99.9% reduction)
- **Git Performance Restored**: Repository size normalized, git operations now instantaneous
- **Selective Synchronization**: Only `.cursor/memory-bank/context/` and `workflow/` are Git-tracked
- **Data Integrity Systems**: Duplicate detection, circular dependency prevention, and centralized CRUD validation are ACTIVE and operational
- **Workflow Stability**: Autonomous workflow operates reliably with intelligent routing and loop prevention
- **User Interface**: Complete Streamlit interface with real-time monitoring and interaction capabilities
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent storage with automatic cleanup and semantic search
- **Validation Architecture**: 3-layer validation system (Schema ‚Üí Business Rules ‚Üí Data Integrity) fully operational

### üîß Active Maintenance Areas
- **Installation Script Consistency**: Function `manage_gitignore` in install.sh needs audit to match corrected rules
- **Cross-platform Testing**: New gitignore rules need validation on different operating systems
- **Statistical Monitoring**: Task counters occasionally show inconsistencies (non-critical)
- **Error Message Refinement**: Zod validation errors could provide cleaner user feedback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Constraints
- **MCP Server Deployment**: Modifications to MCP tool code require manual Cursor restart (architectural limitation)
- **Tool Reliability**: Some editing tools (`edit_file`) are unreliable for complex operations; workarounds exist
- **Debug Limitations**: MCP tools cannot use console.log without breaking JSON-RPC communication
- **Gitignore Fragility**: Exception rules are syntax-sensitive and order-dependent

## Current Workload Status (CORRECTED DATA - JULY 2025 UPDATE)

### Active Tasks (2 total - CRITICAL UPDATE)
- **Task #290** (Priority 5): Valider et corriger l'outil replace_content_between post-red√©marrage MCP (`IN_PROGRESS`)
  - **Status**: Corrections techniques appliqu√©es, en attente de red√©marrage MCP utilisateur pour validation finale
  - **Critical Issue**: Outil MCP avec probl√®me de r√©solution de chemin, corrections pr√™tes mais serveur MCP n√©cessite red√©marrage
- **Task #291** (Priority 4): Simplifier la r√®gle task-decomposition en supprimant l'approche critique excessive (`TODO`)
  - **Objective**: Modifier workflow rule pour √©quilibrer efficacit√© et simplicit√© d'approche

### Recent Completed Tasks (VALIDATED DATA)
- **Task #289** (Priority 5): Corriger la d√©claration MCP de l'outil replace_content_between (RESOLVED - led to Task #290)
- **Task #283** (Priority 3): Optimize `experience-execution` rule for rapid manual testing (APPROVED)
- **Task #282** (Priority 4): Correct implementation rule architecture for intelligent routing to experience-execution (APPROVED)
- **Task #280** (Priority 3): URL to Markdown conversion tool in MCP Tools server (APPROVED)
- **Task #275** (Priority 3): Integrate Gemini CLI MCP configuration (APPROVED)

### Critical System Status (REAL-TIME DATA)
- **Total Tasks**: 281 (significant increase from previous 274)
- **Active Workload**: 2 tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Completion Rate**: 99.3% (279 completed/approved out of 281 total)
- **System Health**: Operational with MCP tool requiring user intervention

## Success Metrics (UPDATED WITH REAL DATA - JULY 2025)

### Operational Metrics (Current Performance)
- **Task Completion Rate**: 99.3% (279 completed/approved out of 281 total - CURRENT)
- **Active Task Load**: 2 tasks (1 IN_PROGRESS, 1 TODO)
- **Request Processing Time**: <2 hours average from request to task creation
- **System Uptime**: Continuous autonomous operation since last major fix
- **Data Integrity**: Zero duplicate tasks, zero circular dependencies maintained
- **Git Performance**: <1 second for all git operations (post-cleanup)

### Quality Metrics
- **Validation Effectiveness**: 100% prevention of data integrity violations
- **User Satisfaction**: Responsive request processing and clear status updates
- **Code Quality**: Automated cleanup, proper git hygiene, comprehensive testing
- **Security Posture**: No sensitive files exposed in repository
- **MCP Tool Reliability**: 1 tool requiring attention (replace_content_between), others operational

## Risk Assessment

### RESOLVED RISKS
- **Repository Bloat**: Fixed via massive cleanup (1,203 files removed)
- **Performance Degradation**: Resolved via gitignore corrections
- **Security Exposure**: Eliminated by selective synchronization

### LOW RISK
- **System crashes or data loss**: Robust error handling and backup systems in place
- **Feature regression**: Comprehensive validation prevents breaking changes

### MEDIUM RISK
- **Installation Inconsistency**: New installations may generate old problematic rules (mitigation: task #278 in progress)
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Gitignore rules untested on all platforms (mitigation: testing planned)
- **Development friction**: MCP restart requirement slows iterative development (mitigation: batch changes)

### ACCEPTABLE RISK
- **Statistical inconsistencies**: Non-critical monitoring issues that don't affect core functionality
- **Tool workarounds**: Some tools require alternatives but functionality is preserved

## Strategic Direction

### Immediate (This Week)
- Implement URL to Markdown conversion tool (Task #280)
- Complete Gemini CLI configuration architecture fix (Task #281)
- Continue workflow optimization with new architecture

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Test infrastructure implementation (addressing critical gap identified in task #273)
- Enhanced statistical monitoring consistency
- Performance testing of validation systems

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- Enhanced error messaging and user experience
- Advanced workflow features (parallel task processing, smart dependency resolution)
- Database migration planning (SQLite replacement for JSON files)

### Long Term (3-6 months)
- Multi-user support and role-based access
- Integration with additional development tools
- Machine learning improvements for request understanding and task optimization

## Critical Lessons Learned

### Git Synchronization Complexity
- **Problem**: Gitignore exception syntax is fragile and order-dependent
- **Solution**: Explicit inclusion rules with thorough testing
- **Prevention**: Always validate gitignore rules with `
