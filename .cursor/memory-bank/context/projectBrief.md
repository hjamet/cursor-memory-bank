# Project Brief

## Vision
Create a production-ready autonomous AI agent operating within Cursor IDE that can reliably manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain persistent context across coding sessions without human supervision.

## Core Mission
The agent assists user `hjamet` by autonomously:
- Breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks
- Implementing solutions with appropriate validation and testing
- Maintaining project health through continuous monitoring and cleanup
- Learning from interactions to improve future performance

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Autonomous Workflow Engine**: Infinite loop system (`start-workflow ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí execute ‚Üí remember`) with intelligent step routing and safety mechanisms.
- **Persistent Memory Bank**: JSON-based storage (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`) with semantic search and long-term memory
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring, request submission, and progress tracking
- **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for system integration

### Key Capabilities
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation, dependency tracking, and automatic status transitions
- **Request Processing**: User request intake, analysis, decomposition into actionable tasks
- **Code Operations**: File manipulation, git operations, terminal command execution
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup, semantic search, context preservation

## Current Status: PRODUCTION STABLE WITH ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

### ‚úÖ Recent Major Achievements (2025-07-12)
