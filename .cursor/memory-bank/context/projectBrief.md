# Project Brief

## Vision
To create a robust and autonomous AI agent within the Cursor IDE. This agent will leverage a persistent memory system to manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain context across coding sessions.

## Core Mandate
The agent's primary function is to assist a user (`hjamet`) by autonomously breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks, implementing solutions, and maintaining the project's health.

## Key System Components
- **Autonomous Workflow**: The agent operates on a continuous loop of `remember -> next_rule -> execute`, allowing it to move between states like task decomposition, implementation, and context updates without manual intervention.
- **Memory Bank**: A persistent storage system (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`, context files) that acts as the agent's long-term memory.
- **Streamlit UI**: A web-based interface for the user to submit requests, monitor the agent's progress, and review completed work.
- **MCP Tooling**: A set of custom servers that provide the agent with the necessary capabilities (e.g., terminal access, file system manipulation, Git operations) to perform its tasks.

## Current State & Critical Reality Check

The project is in a phase of **active development with significant systemic instabilities**. Despite progress on the autonomous workflow and core capabilities, the system suffers from fundamental architectural flaws that severely impact reliability and production readiness.

### Critical System Failures (Discovered via Adversarial Audit)

**üö® VALIDATION SYSTEM BREAKDOWN:**
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS**: Duplicate detection system now ACTIVE and blocking identical task titles
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS**: Circular dependency prevention now ACTIVE and preventing A‚ÜíB‚ÜíA cycles  
- ‚úÖ **NEW SYSTEM**: Centralized CRUD validation system operational with 3-layer validation architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Task statistics inconsistencies partially addressed but monitoring remains unreliable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING**: Schema validation error handling needs refinement (causes interruptions vs clean errors)

**üö® DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINT CRITICAL:**
- **MCP Server Restart Requirement**: All modifications to MCP tool code (`.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/mcp_tools/*.js`) require manual Cursor restart to become effective
- **Implementation-Deployment Gap**: Code can pass direct testing but fail in MCP environment due to server caching
- **Unpredictable Development Cycle**: This constraint makes iterative development extremely difficult and unreliable

**üö® DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES:**
- **Duplicate architecture files**: Two `tasks.json` files exist in different locations, creating confusion about data source
- **Corrupted test data**: System contains test tasks with circular dependencies that pollute production data
- **Statistical inconsistencies**: Task counters and status reports are unreliable due to synchronization issues

### Architectural Debt & Technical Challenges

**Workflow Instability**: The autonomous workflow remains prone to edge cases and infinite loops. While recent improvements have addressed some issues, the system lacks comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

**Tool Reliability**: Critical tools like `edit_file` are unreliable for complex operations, forcing workarounds that add complexity and potential failure points.

**Validation Gaps**: The system was built with an assumption of reliable input validation, but the adversarial audit revealed this assumption is fundamentally flawed.

**Performance Unknowns**: Systems like duplicate detection using Levenshtein distance (O(k√ón√óm) complexity) have not been tested under realistic load conditions.

### Development Process Issues

**Overly Optimistic Documentation**: Previous documentation failed to capture the real-world challenges and instabilities, leading to unrealistic expectations about system reliability.

**Insufficient Testing**: The system lacks comprehensive adversarial testing, allowing critical flaws to persist in production.

**Deployment Friction**: The MCP server restart requirement creates significant friction in the development and validation process.

## Immediate Priorities

1. ‚úÖ **System Validation Overhaul**: ~~Implement comprehensive duplicate detection, circular dependency prevention, and data integrity validation~~ **COMPLETED** - All critical validation systems now active
2. **Data Cleanup**: Remove corrupted test data and resolve architectural file duplication (Tasks #259, #256)
3. **Monitoring Improvement**: Complete fix for statistical inconsistencies and implement reliable system health monitoring
4. **Process Documentation**: Clearly document the MCP server restart constraint and its impact on development workflows
5. **Schema Error Handling**: Refine Zod validation error handling to provide clean error messages instead of interruptions

## Realistic Assessment

The system has made **significant progress toward production readiness** with the successful implementation and activation of critical validation systems. The recent adversarial audit and subsequent fixes have addressed the most dangerous data integrity vulnerabilities.

**Major Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection system fully operational
- ‚úÖ Circular dependency prevention active and tested
- ‚úÖ Centralized CRUD validation architecture in place
- ‚úÖ MCP server restart constraint clearly understood and managed

**Remaining Challenges:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data cleanup required (corrupted test data, duplicate architecture files)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Statistical monitoring system still unreliable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema validation error handling needs refinement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Comprehensive load testing of validation systems pending

The vision remains achievable and is now much closer to reality. The system has evolved from "not production-ready" to "requiring final cleanup and monitoring improvements" - a substantial improvement in stability and reliability.
