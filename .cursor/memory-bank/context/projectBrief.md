# Project Brief

## Overview
This project is a modern web application that provides user authentication, task management, and API services. The application is built with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Objectives
- Create a secure authentication system using JWT tokens
- Implement a robust task management system
- Provide RESTful API endpoints for all functionality
- Ensure high code quality with comprehensive testing
- Follow best practices for security and performance

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: Registration, login, logout with JWT tokens
2. **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and track tasks
3. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and logging
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse

## Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement proper error handling throughout
- Follow clean code principles
- Include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Use modern async/await patterns

## Success Criteria
- All authentication flows work securely
- Task management is fully functional
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Test coverage is above 80%
- Application handles errors gracefully

## Vision
To create a robust and autonomous AI agent within Cursor that leverages a persistent memory system to manage complex tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain context across sessions.

## Constraints
-   Operate within the Cursor extension environment.
-   Rely on available tools and APIs provided by Cursor.

## Stakeholders
-   User (hjamet)
-   Cursor AI Agent

## Success Metrics
-   Agent successfully completes complex multi-step tasks autonomously.
-   Memory Bank accurately reflects the project state and agent's knowledge.
-   Users can effectively guide and interact with the agent through the defined mechanisms.
-   Reduction in manual intervention required for agent operations.

## History and Context
This project involves building and refining an autonomous agent system. Recent enhancements include:
- Agent ability to provide feedback on its work by commenting on archived tasks in `userbrief.md` (Task 8).
- Enhancement of the `fix.mdc` rule to include a `git log --grep` search capability for mysterious problems, improving diagnostic abilities (Task 9).
- Optimization of the testing logic in the rule system to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` over systematic automated test creation, reducing complexity and execution time while maintaining code quality (Task 10).
- Simplification of the workflow rules by merging `request-analysis` functionality into `task-decomposition` and streamlining `implementation.mdc` decision logic, reducing complexity while maintaining all essential functionality (Task 11).
- Refactoring of the userbrief management system from a line-based Markdown file to a structured JSON file (`userbrief.json`), improving robustness and enabling ID-based tracking of requests (Task 30).
- Finalized the userbrief refactoring by migrating the core workflow rules (`consolidate-repo`, `task-decomposition`) to use the new MCP tools (`read-userbrief`, `update-userbrief`), fully decoupling the workflow from direct file manipulation of the old `userbrief.md` file (Task 31).
- **UI and Logic Overhaul (Tasks #113, #115, #117, #118):** Performed a significant update to the Streamlit application. This involved refactoring the UI by merging the 'Add Request' page into a tab within the 'Review' page, improving the UI for message display, and fixing a critical bug in the task completion time calculation by introducing a `status_history` array to the task data model. This cycle enhanced both user experience and data accuracy.
