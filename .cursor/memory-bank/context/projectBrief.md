# Project Brief

## Vision
To create a robust and autonomous AI agent within the Cursor IDE. This agent will leverage a persistent memory system to manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain context across coding sessions.

## Core Mandate
The agent's primary function is to assist a user (`hjamet`) by autonomously breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks, implementing solutions, and maintaining the project's health.

## Key System Components
- **Autonomous Workflow**: The agent operates on a continuous loop of `remember -> next_rule -> execute`, allowing it to move between states like task decomposition, implementation, and context updates without manual intervention.
- **Memory Bank**: A persistent storage system (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`, context files) that acts as the agent's long-term memory.
- **Streamlit UI**: A web-based interface for the user to submit requests, monitor the agent's progress, and review completed work.
- **MCP Tooling**: A set of custom servers that provide the agent with the necessary capabilities (e.g., terminal access, file system manipulation, Git operations) to perform its tasks.

## Success Metrics
- The agent successfully completes complex, multi-step user requests.
- The Memory Bank accurately reflects the project's state and the agent's knowledge.
- The user can effectively guide and interact with the agent through the Streamlit UI.
- A reduction in the manual intervention required to manage the development workflow.

## Recent Project History
The project has undergone significant evolution, with a focus on improving the agent's autonomy and the user's experience. Key milestones include:

### Core Infrastructure
- **Workflow Automation**: Implementation of a fully autonomous workflow, removing the need for manual step-by-step guidance.
- **Structured Memory**: Migration from markdown-based memory files to a structured JSON format (`userbrief.json`, `tasks.json`) for more robust data handling and state management.
- **Tooling Enhancements**: Continuous improvement of the underlying MCP servers to provide the agent with more reliable and powerful tools.

### User Interface Evolution
- **Streamlit UI Overhaul**: A major refactoring of the user interface to improve usability. This included creating a centralized component-based architecture, adding a "Work Queue" to the sidebar for better progress tracking, and streamlining the user request and review process.
- **Navigation Improvements**: Updated the UI to use radio button navigation and display a more meaningful task counter in the sidebar.
- **Interactive Notifications**: Enhanced the notification system with clickable indicators that provide intelligent navigation to relevant content areas.
- **Form Management**: Resolved user experience issues with form field clearing and prevented accidental duplicate submissions.

### Recent Enhancements (Latest Cycle)
- **Smart Navigation**: Implemented intelligent redirection from notification alerts to appropriate UI sections, prioritizing Agent Messages over Task Reviews.
- **Enhanced MCP Communication**: Improved the regex_edit tool to provide structured responses with detailed operation status and error handling.
- **User Experience Refinements**: Fixed text area clearing behavior in the Add Request interface, ensuring forms reset properly after successful submissions.

### Quality & Reliability
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements**: Numerous fixes related to agent logic, UI behavior, and data consistency, including addressing critical bugs that affected animations and task time calculations.
- **Tool Reliability**: Ongoing improvements to MCP server stability and communication protocols.
- **Repository Maintenance**: Automated cleanup processes for temporary files and cache management.

## Current State
The project has reached a mature state with a fully functional autonomous workflow system. The agent can successfully process user requests, break them down into actionable tasks, implement solutions, and maintain project health with minimal manual intervention. Recent enhancements have focused on polishing the user experience and improving tool reliability.
