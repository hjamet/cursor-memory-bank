# Project Brief

## Vision
Create a production-ready autonomous AI agent operating within Cursor IDE that can reliably manage complex software development tasks, learn from interactions, and maintain persistent context across coding sessions without human supervision.

## Core Mission
The agent assists user `hjamet` by autonomously:
- Breaking down user requests into actionable development tasks
- Implementing solutions with appropriate validation and testing
- Maintaining project health through continuous monitoring and cleanup
- Learning from interactions to improve future performance

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Autonomous Workflow Engine**: Infinite loop system (`start-workflow ‚Üí next_rule ‚Üí execute ‚Üí remember`) with intelligent step routing and safety mechanisms.
- **Persistent Memory Bank**: JSON-based storage (`tasks.json`, `userbrief.json`) with semantic search and long-term memory
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring, request submission, and progress tracking
- **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for system integration

### Key Capabilities
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation, dependency tracking, and automatic status transitions
- **Request Processing**: User request intake, analysis, decomposition into actionable tasks
- **Code Operations**: File manipulation, git operations, terminal command execution
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup, semantic search, context preservation

## Current Status: PRODUCTION STABLE WITH ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

### ‚úÖ Recent Major Achievements (2025-07-12)
- **MCP Tool Enhancement**: Successfully renamed and improved `url_to_markdown` to `read_webpage` with enhanced documentation for better agent guidance
- **Workflow Rule Refinement**: Modified `experience-execution.md` to enforce real manual testing and eliminate simulation assumptions
- **Interface Improvements**: Completed simplified task view integration in Streamlit interface
- **System Resilience**: Proven self-healing capabilities through autonomous bug detection and resolution

### ‚úÖ Foundational Achievements (2025-07-03)
- **CRITICAL: Workflow Stability Fix**: Permanently resolved critical workflow loop bug with transition counter reset mechanism
- **Critical Security Fix**: Repository cleaned from 1,203 unwanted tracked files (99.9% reduction)
- **Git Performance Restored**: Repository size normalized, git operations now instantaneous
- **Selective Synchronization**: Only `.cursor/memory-bank/context/` and `workflow/` are Git-tracked
- **Data Integrity Systems**: Duplicate detection, circular dependency prevention, and centralized CRUD validation are ACTIVE and operational

### üîß Current Active Maintenance Areas
- **Streamlit Interface Bugs**: Import errors preventing proper app startup (critical technical debt)
- **Cross-platform Testing**: New gitignore rules need validation on different operating systems
- **Statistical Monitoring**: Task counters occasionally show inconsistencies (non-critical)
- **Error Message Refinement**: Zod validation errors could provide cleaner user feedback

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Constraints & Technical Debt
- **MCP Server Deployment**: Modifications to MCP tool code require manual Cursor restart (architectural limitation)
- **Tool Reliability**: Some editing tools (`edit_file`) are unreliable for complex operations; workarounds exist
- **Debug Limitations**: MCP tools cannot use console.log without breaking JSON-RPC communication
- **Streamlit Key Management**: Element key generation must ensure uniqueness across all UI components
- **Execute Command Bug**: stdout/stderr consistently empty in responses (Task #300 addresses this)
