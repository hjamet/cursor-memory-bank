# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Refactor MCP server test file locations to align with standard project structure and enhance MCP server testing capabilities, particularly around Python script interruption and long timeout handling.
- **Current Task Group**: "1. Refactor Test File Locations" from `tasks.md`.
  - **Task 1.1 Logic**: Create new directories `tests/mcp_server_tests/` and `tests/mcp_server_tests/helper_scripts/`.
  - **Task 1.2 Logic**: Move existing MCP test files from `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/` to `tests/mcp_server_tests/`.
  - **Task 1.3 Logic**: Move helper scripts from `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/helper_scripts/` to `tests/mcp_server_tests/helper_scripts/`.
  - **Task 1.4 Logic**: Update paths in the moved test scripts (e.g., `StdioClientTransport` arguments for server path, paths to helper scripts).
- **Relevant Information**: The project's top-level `tests/` directory is the standard location for tests. User directive: Always use `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` for commands.
- **Attention Points**: Ensure all paths in moved test scripts are correctly updated to reflect their new location relative to the MCP server and helper scripts. Verify that the old test directories under `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/` are cleaned up.
- **Dependencies**: Basic file system operations (mkdir, move). Node.js path resolution knowledge for updating test scripts.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Workflow proceeded through `context-loading`, `request-analysis`, `task-decomposition`.
- `tasks.md` updated with detailed tasks for MCP server modifications.
- Previous `architect.mdc` modifications and MCP commit server context are noted but less directly relevant to the immediate coding tasks.

## Lost workflow

**Summary of Last Completed Actions:**

The primary goals of implementing robust timeout limits and process tree killing for the MCP server have been achieved.
- **Timeout Limits (300s):**
    - Implemented in `mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js` (for `execute_command`) and `mcp_tools/terminal_status.js` (for `get_terminal_status`).
    - Argument descriptions in `server.js` (Zod schemas) updated to reflect the 5-minute maximum.
- **Process Tree Killing (Windows/Git Bash):**
    - Added `tree-kill` dependency to `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json` and ran `npm install`.
    - Created `lib/util/process_killer.js` using `tree-kill` for cross-platform process tree termination.
    - Modified `lib/process_manager.js` for Windows: `detached: true`, `shell: false`, `child.unref()`.
    - Updated `mcp_tools/terminal_stop.js` (`handleStopTerminalCommand`) to use `killProcessTree`.
- **Testing:**
    - Created and successfully ran the following tests in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/`:
        - `test_execute_command_timeout_rejection.js`
        - `test_get_terminal_status_timeout_rejection.js`
        - `test_stop_command_tree_kill.js` (using `tests/helper_scripts/persistent_child.sh`)
    - Debugged SDK import paths and `client.callTool` usage in test scripts.
- **Context Files:**
    - `tasks.md` updated to reflect completed tasks.
    - `tests.md` updated to show all new tests as passing.

**Key Files Modified/Created:**
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_status.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_stop.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/util/process_killer.js` (new)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` (Zod schema descriptions)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/test_execute_command_timeout_rejection.js` (new)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/test_get_terminal_status_timeout_rejection.js` (new)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/test_stop_command_tree_kill.js` (new)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/helper_scripts/persistent_child.sh` (new)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`

**New User Instructions (Post-Interruption):**
The user has invoked `@workflow-perdu.mdc` and provided the following new directives:
1.  Always use the `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` tool for command executions.
2.  Conduct direct testing of the MCP server:
    - Test with excessively long timeout values.
    - Test executing and then interrupting a Python script.
3.  The automated tests previously created (`.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/tests/`) are believed to be in an incorrect directory and need to be moved to the "correct location". The correct location needs to be determined.
