# Active Context

## Summary of Fix
- Completed Task 1.1: Simplified `architect.mdc` and added mandatory context file reading as the first step. Used rename-edit-rename workaround.
- Completed Task 2.1: Enhanced critical analysis instructions in `experience-execution.mdc`, focusing on file content.
- Completed Task 2.2: Added anomaly investigation trigger to `experience-execution.mdc`, routing to `request-analysis` if strange results are found.
- Completed Refactor of `experience-execution.mdc` (Tasks 1.1-1.5):
    - Implemented initial command execution with short timeout (30s).
    - Added iterative monitoring loop using `get_terminal_status` with increasing timeouts (max 300s).
    - Integrated `<think>` blocks for analysis during monitoring, allowing optional code investigation and decision to stop/continue.
    - Ensured final analysis step follows the loop.
- Completed Task 1.1 (fix.mdc): Modified `fix.mdc` final step to call `test-implementation` if the fix was for an issue not covered by existing automated tests.

## Lost workflow
- Attempted to execute `task-decomposition` rule for the user request (modify `architect.mdc` and `
