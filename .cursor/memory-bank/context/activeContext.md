# Active Context

## Current Goal
Implement Python output capture using `execa` in the MCP server.

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Refactor `process_manager.js` to use `execa` for command execution, specifically to fix Python output capture.
- **Requirement**: Replace the usage of `child_process.spawn` within `spawnProcess` in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` with the `execa` library. The new implementation must correctly capture `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit_code`, and `pid`, mimicking the previous structure where possible but leveraging `execa`'s handling of streams and process completion.
- **Rationale**: Previous attempts using `child_process.spawn` failed to capture output from Python processes on Windows, despite working for `cmd.exe` commands. `execa` is known for better cross-platform consistency and stream handling.
- **Implementation Plan**:
    1. Ensure `execa` is imported in `process_manager.js`.
    2. Modify the `spawnProcess` function:
        - Remove the complex platform-specific logic for determining `executable`, `args`, and `shell` options for `spawn`.
        - Use `execa(command, { shell: true, stdio: 'pipe', detached: true, cwd: workspaceRoot })`. Using `shell: true` with `execa` is generally safer and simpler as `execa` handles escaping. We might need to adjust this based on testing.
        - Adapt the event handling: `execa` returns a promise that resolves/rejects on completion, and its child process object has `stdout` and `stderr` streams.
        - Capture `pid` from the `execa` child process object.
        - Pipe `child.stdout` and `child.stderr` data to the `stdoutBuffer` and `stderrBuffer` similar to the previous approach OR potentially rely on `execa`'s result object which contains captured output upon completion.
        - The `completionPromise` should resolve with the final state (pid, status, exitCode, stdout, stderr) based on the resolved/rejected promise from `execa`.
    3. Test the implementation with `python --version` and `python -c "..."` commands.
- **Key Files Involved**:
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (Main file to modify)
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json` (Verify `execa` dependency)
- **Considerations**:
    - `execa` handles process termination and output buffering differently than raw `spawn`. The promise-based approach might simplify the `handleExit`/`handleClose`/`handleError` logic significantly.
    - Ensure the state updates in `StateManager` are still performed correctly.
    - The `killProcess` function might also need adaptation if it relies on `process.kill` and specific signal handling that `execa` might abstract differently.

## Key Files Involved
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (May need inspection, but perhaps no changes)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/state_manager.js` 
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/logger.js` (May need modification for reading full logs)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`

## Next Steps
- Implement the waiting logic and conditional response construction in `handleExecuteCommand` (`terminal_execution.js`).
- Potentially adapt `Logger.readLogLines` to read full file content.

## Lost workflow

- Identified that `npm install` failed for the MCP server due to an incorrect version specifier for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in `package.json`.
- Verified available versions using `npm view`.
- Updated `package.json` (`.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json`) to use `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` version `^1.10.2`.
- Successfully ran `npm install` in the `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server` directory.
- The immediate goal is to ensure the MCP server runs correctly and captures output from Python scripts as intended, focusing on the changes made in `process_manager.js`.

## Experiment Results

- **Experiment**: Verify Python output capture (2025-04-27)
- **Command**: `python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.write('stdout_test\n'); sys.stderr.write('stderr_test\n')"`
- **Result**: Failed (Exit Code 1)
- **Output**: stdout="", stderr=""
- **Analysis**: Unexpected failure. Python execution or output capture in `process_manager.js` is likely flawed. Further investigation needed.
