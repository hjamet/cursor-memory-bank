# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Previous Task (Completed)**: Refactor Commit Message Generation across workflow rules.
    - **Outcome**: The `description` field for `mcp_MyMCP_commit` in rules `context-update.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, and `fix.mdc` now requires a highly verbose markdown format with sections for Changes, Testing, Observations, and a Conclusion. The standard is defined in `context-update.mdc`.
- **Completed Main Task**: Update Memory Bank File Formats & Integrate Templates (Task 2 from `tasks.md`).
    - **Outcome**: All memory bank files (`userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, `tests.md`) and context files (`projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) now have their formats and structural guidance defined directly within their primary managing rules. All corresponding template files in `.cursor/rules/templates/` have been deleted. Emoji-based status systems are implemented for `userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, and `tests.md`.
    - **Sub-Task (2.1 - Completed)**: `userbrief.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `consolidate-repo.mdc` was updated to handle a section-less, emoji-driven `userbrief.md`. The new format and emoji legend (🆕, ⏳, 📌, 🗄️) are defined within `consolidate-repo.mdc`.
    - **Sub-Task (2.2 - Completed)**: `tasks.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `task-decomposition.mdc` was updated to define and handle a section-less, emoji-driven `tasks.md` format (⚪️, 🟡, 🟢, 🔴, 🔵). `context-update.mdc` was also updated for compatibility.
    - **Sub-Task (2.3 - Completed)**: `tests.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `test-execution.mdc` was updated to define and handle a section-less `tests.md` format (header line with counts ✅❌ℹ️, followed by list of ❌/ℹ️ tests only). `fix.mdc` was also updated for compatibility.
    - **Sub-Task (2.4 - Completed)**: Context Files (`projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: Modified `context-loading.mdc` and `context-update.mdc` to define the structure of `projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `techContext.md` directly within these rules by integrating guidance from their respective template files. This centralizes format definitions within the managing rules.
    - **Sub-Task (2.5 - Completed)**: Delete Template Files.
        -   **Outcome**: All files from the `.cursor/rules/templates/` directory were deleted, as their essential guidance has been integrated into the operational rules.
