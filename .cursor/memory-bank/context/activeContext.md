# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Task**: Fix Format Violations in `userbrief.md`
    - **Origin**: Detected by `consolidate-repo.mdc` during format checks.
    - **Issue**: Lines 2, 3, and 4 of `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` (which were ` ```text`, ` [...]`, and ` ``` `) did not conform to the expected emoji-prefixed format.
    - **Action**: Removed these three offending lines. `userbrief.md` should now be correctly formatted.

- **Previously Completed Task (Task 4 from `tasks.md`): Enhance `consolidate-repo` with Memory File Format Validation**
    - **Outcome**: Modified `consolidate-repo.mdc` (Step 2 and Step 5) to include validation checks for key memory files (`userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, `tests.md`, and context files). If violations are found, `consolidate-repo` will now formulate a request detailing these violations and call `request-analysis`.
    - **Next Steps**: Task 4 is 游릭 DONE. All tasks in `tasks.md` are now complete.

- **Previously Completed Main Task**: Fix MCP Commit Tool Multi-line Description (Task 5 from `tasks.md`).
    - **(Details omitted for brevity, Task 5 is 游릭 DONE.)**

- **Previously Completed Main Task**: Update General Rules for Consistency (Task 3 from `tasks.md`).
    - **(Details omitted for brevity, Task 3 is 游릭 DONE.)**

- **Previously Completed Main Task**: Update Memory Bank File Formats & Integrate Templates (Task 2 from `tasks.md`).
    - **(Details omitted for brevity, Task 2 is 游릭 DONE.)**

- **Previously Completed Task**: Refactor Commit Message Generation across workflow rules (Task 1 from `tasks.md`).
    - **(Details omitted for brevity, Task 1 is 游릭 DONE.)**

*(Historical context largely removed, focusing on the completion of all major tasks and recent fixes.)*
