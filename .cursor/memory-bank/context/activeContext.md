# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Enhancements and Rule Updates
- **Completed Tasks:**
    - 1.1 Set Default CWD for `mcp_execute_command` in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
    - 2.1 Updated rules (`experience-execution.mdc`, `fix.mdc`, `implementation.mdc`) to recommend MCP terminal tools.
- **Goal:** Modifications requested in `userbrief.md` have been implemented.

## Current Status

- MCP server (`server.js`) now executes commands in project root by default.
- Relevant rules now recommend using the advanced MCP terminal tools with explanations.
- Ready for context cleanup and commit.

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented tasks 1.1 and 2.1.
- Chose to proceed to `context-update` as changes were modifications to existing features without dedicated tests or pure documentation updates.

## Next Steps

1. Clean up context files.
2. Update `tasks.md` (move tasks to Done).
3. Commit changes.
4. Verify file integrity.
5. Determine the next rule based on remaining tasks/test status.

## Important Notes

- None currently.
