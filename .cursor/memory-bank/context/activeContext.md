# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- Completed modifications to MCP tools based on userbrief.md request:
  - Modified `execute_command` (`terminal_execution.js`): Changed `MAX_CHARS_EXEC_PARTIAL` to 1500, used `readLastLogChars`, added prefix logic for limit hit.
  - Modified `get_terminal_status` (`terminal_status.js`): Changed `MAX_CHARS_STATUS` to 1500, added prefix logic for limit hit.
- Attempted test execution (`tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`), failed due to known MCP incompatibility (silent exit 1).

## Summary of Recent Changes

- Executed `implementation` rule:
    - Modified `terminal_execution.js` (MCP tool).
    - Modified `terminal_status.js` (MCP tool).
- Called `context-loading` -> `consolidate-repo` -> `request-analysis` -> `implementation`.
- Analyzed user request (from userbrief.md) to modify MCP `execute_command` and `get_terminal_status` tools.
