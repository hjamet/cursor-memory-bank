# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** Implement Architect Verification Workflow (tasks.md Section 2)
- **Current Task:** 2.1 Define Verification Workflow in `architect.mdc`.
- **Goal:** Add a new major section to `architect.mdc` outlining the step-by-step iterative verification process for the architect agent.
- **Logic:** The workflow should involve querying MCP Memory, analyzing project state against stored vision/preferences, documenting findings, and repeating.
- **Details:** Specify tools like MCP search, file reading, semantic search. Define loop steps (Query -> Analyze -> Document -> Repeat).
- **Dependencies:** Task 2.2 (Update Example) depends on this definition. Task 1.1 (Memory Strategy) is a prerequisite.

## Current Status

- Starting implementation of Task 2.1.
- Task 1.1 (Define Memory Strategy) and 1.2 (Integrate Memory Storage) are functionally complete (will be marked in `tasks.md` later).

## Lost workflow

- **Trigger:** User manually invoked `workflow-perdu` rule.
- **Last Action:** Successfully edited `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` to add a principle mandating the storage of user vision/preferences/directives into MCP Memory, completing Task 1.2 from `tasks.md`.
- **Files Involved:** `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`.
- **Next Planned Step:** According to `tasks.md`, the next step was Task 2.1: Defining the verification workflow in `architect.mdc`.
