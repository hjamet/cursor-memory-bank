# Active Context

**Current State:** Completed implementation of MCP memory integration into workflow rules (`request-analysis`, `implementation`, `fix`).

**Ongoing Task:** Finalizing changes and checking workflow status.

## Current implementation context
- **Tasks performed:** Modified the three rules (`request-analysis`, `implementation`, `fix`) to add optional calls to `mcp_servers_search_nodes` for retrieving relevant memories and `mcp_servers_add_observations` for storing new memories.
- **Logic Applied:** Integrated memory access at logical points within each rule's workflow (start/end of analysis, before/after implementation, start/end of fix cycle).
- **Relevant Info:** Web search confirmed the value of knowledge graphs for persistent agent memory.
- **Attention Points:** Ensured MCP tool calls are optional steps to maintain core rule functionality even without MCP interaction. Maintained use of `.cursor/memory-bank` files.
- **Technical Decisions:** Added placeholders for MCP calls, specific content for observations will depend on runtime context.

## Problèmes Résolus
- MCP memory integration tasks completed.

## Problèmes Persistants
- N/A

## Décisions Récentes
- [Current Date] - Completed modifications to `request-analysis.mdc`, `implementation.mdc`, and `fix.mdc`.
- [Current Date] - Decision to decompose the request into three distinct tasks, one for each rule modification.

## Prochaines Étapes
- Update `tasks.md`.
- Verify file integrity.
- Commit changes.
- Check overall workflow status (tests/remaining tasks).

## Notes Importantes
The integration adds optional memory capabilities using MCP servers, enhancing the agent's context without altering the fundamental rule structures.
