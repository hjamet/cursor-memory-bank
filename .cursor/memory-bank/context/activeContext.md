# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Async Terminal Feature Completion
- **Current Task:** Context update after successful test execution.
- **Goal:** Finalize the implementation and testing cycle for the async terminal features.
- **Previous Action:** Successfully fixed the "Method not found" error in `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` by modifying the client-side RPC call format to use `method: 'tools/call'` and passing the tool name (`name: '...'`) and arguments (`arguments: {...}`) within the `params` object.
- **Dependencies:** `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`, `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.

## Current Status

- All async terminal features (`execute_command`, `get_terminal_status`, `get_terminal_output`, `stop_terminal_command`) are implemented in `server.js`.
- The integration test `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` now passes, verifying the core workflow.
- All tasks in `tasks.md` related to this feature are marked as complete.
