# Active Context

## Current Goal
Verify the behavior of the `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` tool as requested by the user.

## Current implementation context
- **Task Completed**: Verified that `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` successfully terminates OS-level processes.
- **Methodology**:
    1. Started a `sleep 600` process using `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` (PID 10788).
    2. Confirmed the process was listed via `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status`.
    3. Called `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` for PID 10788.
    4. Confirmed the process was removed from the MCP server list via `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status`.
    5. Confirmed the OS process was terminated using `tasklist /FI "PID eq 10788"` via `run_terminal_cmd`.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (updated with verification result).
- **Status**: Verification complete. The tool works as expected, contradicting the initial suspicion.
