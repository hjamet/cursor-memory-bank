# Active Context

## Current Goal
DONE - ~~Attempt final investigation into why `execute_command` doesn't return full stdout/stderr immediately for early-completing commands, focusing on `Logger.readLogLines`.~~

## Current implementation context
- **Problem**: `execute_command` failed to include stdout/stderr in its immediate response for commands finishing before the timeout.
- **Investigation**: Added debug logging to `Logger.readLogLines` and re-ran tests.
- **Root Cause**: The issue was traced to `readLogLines` misinterpreting the `lineCount: -1` parameter (passed by `terminal_execution.js` for early completion) due to `lines.slice(-lineCount)` becoming `lines.slice(1)`, thus skipping the first line of output.
- **Fix**: Modified `readLogLines` to correctly handle `lineCount < 1` by returning all lines instead of using `slice` incorrectly.
- **Verification**: Re-running `echo "Hello, world!"` confirmed that `execute_command` now correctly returns the stdout immediately.
- **Cleanup**: Removed debug logging code and files.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/logger.js`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js`.
- **Status**: Issue resolved.
- **Next Steps**: Commit the changes.
