# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Refactor MCP server test file locations to align with standard project structure and enhance MCP server testing capabilities, particularly around Python script interruption and long timeout handling.
- **Completed Task Group**: "1. Refactor Test File Locations" from `tasks.md`.
  - All sub-tasks (1.1 to 1.4) involving directory creation, file moves, and path updates in test scripts are complete.
  - Moved tests (`test_execute_command_timeout_rejection.js`, `test_get_terminal_status_timeout_rejection.js`, `test_stop_command_tree_kill.js`) are confirmed passing in their new location (`tests/mcp_server_tests/`) after fixing `__dirname` and script path issues.
- **Next Task Group**: "2. Enhance MCP Server Testing" from `tasks.md`.
  - Task 2.1: Create Python helper script.
  - Task 2.2: Implement Python script execution/interruption test.
  - Task 2.3: Test long valid timeout behavior.
- **Relevant Information**: User directive: Always use `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` for commands.
- **Attention Points**: For next tasks, ensure Python script correctly signals its termination state. Ensure new tests robustly check MCP server behavior.
- **Dependencies**: Node.js for test scripts, Python for helper script.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Workflow proceeded through `workflow-perdu`, `request-analysis`, `task-decomposition`, `implementation`, `test-execution`, and `fix` rules.
- Tasks for refactoring test locations were defined in `tasks.md`.
- Test files were moved to `tests/mcp_server_tests/` and paths updated.
- `__dirname` and script path issues in moved tests were resolved.
- All moved tests are confirmed passing.
