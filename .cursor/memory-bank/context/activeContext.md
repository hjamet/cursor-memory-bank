# Active Context

## Current Goal
Implement Task 1: Enhance `mcp_execute_command` for immediate output.

## Current implementation context
- **Previous Task**: Add `cwd` to MCP Terminal Responses (Completed & Tested).
- **Test Results**: `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` passed after adding `cwd`, confirming no regressions.
- **Note**: A minor discrepancy was observed where the reported `cwd` was the `.cursor` subdirectory instead of the project root set in spawn options. This needs further investigation if precise CWD is critical, but doesn't block current progress.
- **Current Task**: Enhance `mcp_execute_command` to return full stdout/stderr directly if command finishes within timeout.

## Key Files Involved
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/terminal_execution.js` (Likely needs modification)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (May need adjustments to facilitate early output retrieval)
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/state_manager.js` 
- `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`

## Next Steps
- Analyze `terminal_execution.js` and `process_manager.js` to implement immediate output return for `execute_command`.
