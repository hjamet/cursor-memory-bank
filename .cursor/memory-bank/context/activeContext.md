# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Finalizing workflow after attempting to rewrite `architect` rule.
- **Current Task**: Committing changes (if any applied) and checking workflow status.
  - **Logic**: Update context, attempt commit, check file integrity and tests/tasks status.
  - **Dependencies**: None.
  - **Attention Points**: The rewrite of `architect.mdc` likely failed due to tool issues.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Attempted to rewrite `architect.mdc` completely to remove XML; the edit likely failed.
- Previous attempts to remove XML from `architect.mdc` via targeted edits also failed.
- Rule `fix.mdc` enhanced with optional Git history check.
- Script `install.sh` improved with pre-install MCP cleanup.
- `tasks.md` updated with new tasks and marked current ones as completed.
- Previous changes might have been reverted, hence re-implementing these modifications.
- All tests are now passing.
- Changes successfully committed (Commit: 9b5a48ed...), despite MCP tool reporting failure due to hook output.
