# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- Completed Task: Refined `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` "statut" command output.
  - Implemented progress bars using 10 colored square emojis (ðŸŸ©/â¬œ).
  - Added a test status summary section (counts and brief reasons for non-passing tests).
  - Ensured overall output remains concise and colorful.
  - Used rename-edit-rename workflow via `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Called `context-loading` -> `request-analysis` -> `implementation` -> `context-update`.
- Implemented user request to refine `architect.mdc` status output (emoji bars, test summary).
  - Renamed `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` to `.md`.
  - Edited `.cursor/rules/architect.md` to include emoji bars and test summary logic.
  - Renamed `.cursor/rules/architect.md` back to `.mdc`.
- User requested further refinement of `architect.mdc` status output (emoji bars, test summary).
- Called `context-loading` -> `request-analysis` -> `implementation`.
- Completed previous workflow cycle, confirming no remaining tasks or test failures.
- Made commit ":art: style: Refine architect rule output for conciseness".
- Called `context-loading` -> `request-analysis` -> `implementation` -> `context-update`.
- Implemented user request to modify `architect.mdc` output format (concise, progress bars).
  - Renamed `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` to `.md`.
  - Edited `.cursor/rules/architect.md` with new concise output format for 'statut' command.
  - Renamed `.cursor/rules/architect.md` back to `.mdc`.
- Called `context-loading` -> `request-analysis` -> `implementation`.
- Analyzed user request to modify `architect.mdc` output format.
- Completed task: Added "status" command feature to `architect.mdc` rule.
  - Modified `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` using rename-edit-rename workflow.
  - Added logic to check for "statut" input, gather info (memory files, git log), analyze task progress, and format/display a status report.
- Executed `implementation` rule:
    - Renamed `architect.mdc` to `.md`.
    - Edited `.cursor/rules/architect.md` to add status command logic.
    - Renamed `architect.md` back to `.mdc`.

- Verified memory file integrity (no issues found).
- Cleaned up finished MCP terminal process.
- Manually tested refactored `commit` MCP tool; confirmed auto-CWD and reporting work correctly.
- Verified `fix.mdc` implementation for regression test trigger task (Task 2); moved task to Done.
- Refactored `commit` MCP tool (`commit.js`, `server.js`, `process_manager.js`) for auto-CWD detection and repo name reporting.
- User request received to change `commit` tool: remove explicit `working_directory`, add auto-CWD detection, add repo name reporting.
- *Previous change (being reverted/modified)*: Modified `commit` MCP tool (`commit.js`, `server.js`) to accept `working_directory` argument and report committed files.
- Updated rule system (`request-analysis`, `fix`, `implementation`, `experience-execution`, `architect`):
    - Replaced Memory MCP with a file-based system using markdown notes in `.cursor/memory` for high-level vision/preferences.
    - Replaced generic web search tool with `mcp_brave-search_brave_web_search`.
    - Created `.cursor/memory` directory.
    - Used rename-edit-rename workflow (with `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`) for rule modification.
