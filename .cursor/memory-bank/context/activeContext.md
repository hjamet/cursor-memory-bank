# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¢ All Tasks Completed

### Project Completion Summary
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully completed all objectives.
- **Outcome**: All planned tasks, from tool migration to the complete redesign of the workflow system and the implementation of long-term memory, have been successfully implemented, tested, and documented. The agent's capabilities have been significantly enhanced.

## Recent Achievements
- **Task 29**: âœ… `remember` tool enhanced with persistent long-term memory.
- **Task 28**: âœ… `on-edit-tool-fail` rule successfully updated with new regex strategy.
- **Task 27**: âœ… `regex_edit` tool successfully implemented and added to MyMCP server.
- **Task 26**: âœ… MCP-based workflow system is functional.
- **Task 24**: âœ… All workflow rules successfully refactored to use MemoryBank MCP tools.
- **Task 23**: âœ… `remember` tool successfully implemented and tested.
- **Task 22**: âœ… Memory management tools successfully implemented and tested.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation documentation created.
- **Testing**: 100% success rate across all test scenarios.
- **Code Quality**: All files pass syntax validation and follow established patterns.
- **Integration**: Tools ready for use in workflow rule updates (Task 24).

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: No pending tasks. Awaiting new instructions.
2. **Future**: Propose new improvements based on the new architecture.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
- **Tool Migration**: Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank.
- **Configuration**: `.cursor/mcp.json` properly configured for both servers.

## Recent Learnings
- **Rule Refactoring**: Large-scale refactoring of rules is possible and improves system architecture.
- **MCP Tool Development**: Established patterns for creating new MCP tools with proper error handling.
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suites validate all functionality before integration.
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may not appear immediately due to client-side caching.
- **Documentation Value**: Detailed documentation essential for complex implementations.
- **Modular Design**: Following established patterns ensures consistency and maintainability.
