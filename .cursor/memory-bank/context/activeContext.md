# Active Context

## Completed Task: 游릭 11. Simplify Workflow Rules and Merge Request-Analysis with Task-Decomposition
- **Origin**: User request to simplify the rule system workflow.
- **Outcome**: Successfully streamlined the workflow by simplifying `implementation.mdc` decision logic and merging `request-analysis` functionality into `task-decomposition`. This reduces complexity and improves efficiency while maintaining all essential functionality.
- **Key Changes Implemented**:
    1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Simplified decision logic by moving all next rule calling exclusively to Step 5. Agent now completes all sub-tasks first, then decides between `experience-execution` (default) or `context-update` (rare cases with no executable code changes).
    2. **`task-decomposition.mdc`**: Enhanced with comprehensive analysis capabilities including request analysis, code analysis with codebase search (max 3), research with Context7 tools or web search (max 5), and vision storage functionality. Removed tree creation step while preserving all existing task decomposition functionality.
    3. **Rule References**: Updated all references to `request-analysis` with `task-decomposition` in affected rules: `consolidate-repo.mdc`, `context-loading.mdc`, `fix.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, `system.mdc`, `workflow-perdu.mdc`, `new-chat.mdc`.
    4. **Cleanup**: Deleted obsolete `request-analysis.mdc` file after successful migration.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**:
    - 游릭 **11.1. Simplify `implementation.mdc` Decision Logic**: Completed.
    - 游릭 **11.2. Enhance `task-decomposition.mdc` with Analysis Capabilities**: Completed.
    - 游릭 **11.3. Update Rule References**: Completed.
    - 游릭 **11.4. Delete Obsolete `request-analysis.mdc`**: Completed.
- **Technical Decisions**:
    - Prioritized workflow simplicity and efficiency over granular separation of concerns.
    - Maintained the autonomous nature of the agent while reducing decision complexity.
    - Preserved all essential functionality including vision storage during the merge process.
    - Ensured workflow continuity by updating all rule references systematically.

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Optimized testing logic in rule system to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` (Task 10).
- Enhanced `fix.mdc` with Git log search for mysterious problems (Task 9).
- Enhanced `context-update` to add agent comments to archived `userbrief.md` tasks (Task 8).
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7).
- Completed major refactoring of memory bank file formats and commit message generation (Tasks 1-6).

## Current implementation context
- All planned tasks from the current user request cycle are complete. Workflow is concluding.
