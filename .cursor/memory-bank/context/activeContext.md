# Active Context

## Current Focus
Successfully completed Task 40 - enhancement of MCP task management tools with improved validation, filtering, and status management capabilities.

## Recent Decisions
- Enhanced MCP task management tools with comprehensive validation
- Improved filtering capabilities in get_all_tasks and get_next_tasks
- Added proper status transition validation in update_task
- Strengthened input validation across all task management tools

## Recent Implementation
**Task 40 Completion**: Enhanced MCP task management system
- **Task 40.1**: Enhanced create_task.js with improved validation for dependencies, priority ranges, and required fields
- **Task 40.2**: Enhanced update_task.js with status transition validation and comprehensive field updates
- **Task 40.3**: Enhanced get_all_tasks.js with advanced filtering capabilities (status, priority, dependencies)
- **Task 40.4**: Enhanced get_next_tasks.js with dependency resolution and filtering options

## Current Repository State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP fully operational and enhanced
- **Task Management**: Robust validation and filtering system implemented
- **Tool Schemas**: All enhanced with proper validation and comprehensive options

## Next Steps
1. Commit the enhanced MCP task management tools
2. Monitor enhanced tool functionality in real usage
3. Continue with any pending development tasks

## Important Notes
- All MCP task management tools now have comprehensive validation
- Enhanced filtering capabilities improve task discovery and management
- Status transition validation ensures data integrity
- Dependency resolution logic improved for better task ordering

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP fully operational and tested
- **Tool Schemas**: All tool argument descriptions properly exported and functioning
