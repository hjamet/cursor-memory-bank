# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Previous Task (Completed)**: Refactor Commit Message Generation across workflow rules.
    - **Outcome**: The `description` field for `mcp_MyMCP_commit` in rules `context-update.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, and `fix.mdc` now requires a highly verbose markdown format with sections for Changes, Testing, Observations, and a Conclusion. The standard is defined in `context-update.mdc`.
- **Current Main Task**: Update Memory Bank File Formats & Integrate Templates (Task 2 from `tasks.md`).
    - **Previous Sub-Task (2.1 - Completed)**: `userbrief.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `consolidate-repo.mdc` was updated to handle a section-less, emoji-driven `userbrief.md`. The new format and emoji legend (🆕, ⏳, 📌, 🗄️) are defined within `consolidate-repo.mdc`.
    - **Previous Sub-Task (2.2 - Completed)**: `tasks.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `task-decomposition.mdc` was updated to define and handle a section-less, emoji-driven `tasks.md` format (⚪️, 🟡, 🟢, 🔴, 🔵). `context-update.mdc` was also updated for compatibility.
    - **Previous Sub-Task (2.3 - Completed)**: `tests.md` Refactor.
        -   **Outcome**: `test-execution.mdc` was updated to define and handle a section-less `tests.md` format (header line with counts ✅❌ℹ️, followed by list of ❌/ℹ️ tests only). `fix.mdc` was also updated for compatibility.
    - **Current Sub-Task (2.4)**: Context Files (`projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) Refactor.
        -   **Objective**: Modify `context-loading.mdc` and `context-update.mdc` to define the structure of these files directly within the rules, removing reliance on section titles if appropriate, or ensuring the rules clearly state the expected (potentially section-less) structure. Integrate content/guidance from their respective template files (`.cursor/rules/templates/projectBrief-template.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/templates/activeContext-template.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/templates/techContext-template.mdc`). These templates will be deleted in sub-task 2.5.
        -   **Impacted Rules/Files**: `context-loading.mdc`, `context-update.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/templates/projectBrief-template.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/templates/activeContext-template.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/templates/techContext-template.mdc`.
        -   **Current Focus**: Implementing changes for Task 2.4. The subsequent Task 4 (Enhance `consolidate-repo` with Memory File Format Validation) has been processed by `task-decomposition` and its corresponding `userbrief.md` item archived.
    - **Overall Objective (Task 2)**: Remove section titles from `userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, `tests.md` (and potentially context files). Implement emoji-based status systems. Define these new formats directly within the managing rules. Delete template files from `.cursor/rules/templates/`.
