# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¢ Task 25 - Create New Branch for Memory Bank MCP Development (COMPLETED)

### Task 25 Completion Summary
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully completed all objectives.
- **Branch Created**: `memory-bank-mcp`
- **Action**: Switched to the new branch for all future development.
- **Outcome**: Development work for the MCP workflow system is now isolated from the `master` branch.

## Current Implementation Context: Task 26 - Design and Implement MCP-Based Workflow System

### Next Priority: Task 26
- **Objective**: Completely redesign the workflow system to use MCP tools instead of .mdc files.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 22, 23, 24, 25 (âœ… Completed).

### Upcoming Tasks Overview
- **Task 27**: Add regex-based edit tool to MyMCP server as fallback.
- **Task 28**: Update on-edit-tool-fail rule to use new regex tool.
- **Task 29**: Enhance recall tool with long-term memory database.

### Dependencies and Workflow
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks 23-24 depend on Task 22 completion (âœ…)
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks 27-29 can be developed independently
- **Major Redesign**: Task 26 represents complete workflow system overhaul

## Technical Implementation Status

### MemoryBank MCP Server Current State
- **Total Tools**: 10 tools (9 original + `remember` tool)
- **New Tools**: read_memory, edit_memory, remember (all fully functional)
- **Server Status**: âœ… Starts successfully with all tools registered
- **Registration Format**: âœ… Proper 3-parameter format maintained
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may require Cursor restart (documented issue)

### Memory Management Tools Specifications
- **read_memory**: Takes context_file enum, returns complete content with metadata
- **edit_memory**: Takes context_file enum + content, completely replaces existing content
- **remember**: Takes past, present, future strings and stores them in a capped JSON log.
- **File Path Mapping**: activeContext, projectBrief, techContext â†’ corresponding .md files
- **Error Handling**: Validates file names, handles missing files with clear suggestions

## Recent Achievements
- **Task 24**: âœ… All workflow rules successfully refactored to use MemoryBank MCP tools.
- **Task 23**: âœ… `remember` tool successfully implemented and tested.
- **Task 22**: âœ… Memory management tools successfully implemented and tested.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation documentation created.
- **Testing**: 100% success rate across all test scenarios.
- **Code Quality**: All files pass syntax validation and follow established patterns.
- **Integration**: Tools ready for use in workflow rule updates (Task 24).

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Proceed to Task 26 (complete workflow system redesign).
2. **Short-term**: Complete workflow system redesign (Task 26).
3. **Client Access**: Users may need to restart Cursor to access new memory tools.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on master, will create "Memory Bank MCP" branch for Task 25
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank (10 tools) and MyMCP (6 tools) operational
- **Tool Migration**: Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank
- **Configuration**: .cursor/mcp.json properly configured for both servers

## Recent Learnings
- **Rule Refactoring**: Large-scale refactoring of rules is possible and improves system architecture.
- **MCP Tool Development**: Established patterns for creating new MCP tools with proper error handling.
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suites validate all functionality before integration.
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may not appear immediately due to client-side caching.
- **Documentation Value**: Detailed documentation essential for complex implementations.
- **Modular Design**: Following established patterns ensures consistency and maintainability.
