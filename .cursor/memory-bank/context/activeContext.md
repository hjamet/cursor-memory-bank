# Active Context

## Current Goal
Completed testing of the modified `mcp_execute_command` immediate return behavior.

## Current implementation context
- **Test Results**: 
    - Improvement: `execute_command` now correctly returns *partial* stdout/stderr immediately when the command times out.
    - Persistent Issue: `execute_command` still does *not* return *full* stdout/stderr immediately when the command completes *before* the timeout. Full output requires a follow-up call (`get_terminal_status` or `get_terminal_output`).
- **Summary**: The core requirement of providing partial output for long-running commands (to allow monitoring/interruption) is met. The ideal behavior for short commands is not fully achieved, but the necessary information is available via follow-up calls.
- **Files Modified**: 
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js` (Implemented partial return on timeout)
    - `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (Updated ad-hoc test results)
- **Next Steps**: Commit changes and check final workflow status.
