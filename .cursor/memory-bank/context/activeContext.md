# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Objective**: Refactor `process_manager.js` to use the `execa` library instead of `node:child_process.spawn`.
- **Task**: Replace `spawn` calls and related event handling (`data`, `error`, `exit`) with `execa` equivalents.
- **Rationale**: `execa` provides a more user-friendly API, better promise support, and potentially more robust handling of processes compared to the base `child_process` module.
- **Files/Symbols involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `execa` library.
- **Key Considerations**:
    - Ensure the `execa` implementation replicates the existing functionality: detached process execution, capturing PID, command, status, stdout/stderr logging, and correct state updates in `StateManager`.
    - Verify compatibility with existing logging mechanisms (`Logger.log`).
    - Maintain the structure of `spawnProcess` and `killProcess` functions as much as possible.
    - Need to import `execa`.
- **Dependencies**: `execa` library (installed).
- **Next Step**: Begin implementing the changes in `process_manager.js`.

## Current Status

- Workflow started, `context-loading`, `request-analysis`, and `task-decomposition` completed.
- Ready to begin implementation based on tasks in `tasks.md` (Section 1).

## Recent Decisions

- Confirmed use of ES Modules (ESM) for the refactored code based on existing `server.js` and Node.js best practices.
- Prioritize reliable output capture in `process_manager.js` by handling stream events correctly.

## Next Steps

- Implement tasks from Section 1 of `tasks.md`, starting with 1.1 (Create Directory Structure and Files).

## Important Notes

- Adhere strictly to existing MCP tool signatures.
- Use `run_terminal_cmd` (not the MCP tool) for running tests (`tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`) until refactoring is complete and verified.

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` (Section 1 & 2)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Files to Create/Modify:** See "Files/Modules Involved" above.
- **Key Functions/Classes:** `McpServer` (from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`), `spawn` (from `node:child_process`), `fs` module functions, ESM `import`/`export`.

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A for this task.
- **Relevant Tests:** `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` (to be run in Task 2.1).

## Documentation Context
- **Relevant Files:** Node.js `child_process` documentation.
- **Key Concepts:** MCP Server, Node.js Streams, ESM Modules, Asynchronous Programming.

## Lost workflow

I was preparing to refactor `process_manager.js` by installing the `execa` library in the `mcp-commit-server`. 

- **Files involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`
- **Action**: Successfully ran `npm install execa` in the server directory.
- **Next Step according to tasks.md**: Refactor `process_manager.js`.
