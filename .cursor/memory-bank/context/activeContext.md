# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is to validate and improve the new MemoryBank MCP server tools based on a user request. This involves three main tasks:
1.  Investigating why some tools (`remember`, `next_rule`) appear without arguments in the UI.
2.  Improving the argument descriptions for all MemoryBank tools to be more explicit.
3.  Systematically testing all MemoryBank tools to ensure they function correctly.

## Current implementation context
-   **Tasks to perform**: I am starting with Task 32: "Investigate and Fix MCP Tool Argument Visibility". My analysis during the `task-decomposition` phase suggests this is likely a client-side caching issue in Cursor, as the server-side code appears correct. I will formalize this investigation.
-   **Next, I will work on Task 33**: "Improve MCP Tool Argument Descriptions" by editing `server.js` to make the Zod schema descriptions more explicit about optional/required parameters.
-   **Finally, I will address Task 34**: "Systematically Test MCP Memory Bank Tools" by invoking the `experience-execution` rule.

## Next Steps
1.  Complete the investigation and implementation for tasks 32 and 33.
2.  Execute task 34 to generate an experiment report validating the tools.
3.  Commit the changes.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`. The old `userbrief.md` has been deleted.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
