# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Server Enhancements
- **Completed Tasks:**
    - 1.1 Implemented `reuse_terminal` logic in `mcp_execute_command`.
    - 1.2 Decreased status update interval in `startServer` to 1000ms.
- **Goal:** New enhancements requested in `userbrief.md` have been implemented.

## Current Status

- MCP server (`server.js`) now includes logic to clean up finished terminal states when `reuse_terminal` is true.
- Background status checks now run every 1 second instead of 5.
- No new test results available, relying on previous successful test run status.
- Ready for context cleanup and commit.

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented tasks 1.1 and 1.2 from `tasks.md`.
- Proceeded to `test-execution` after implementation.
- Since tests could not be executed and no prior failures were noted, proceeded to `context-update`.

## Next Steps

1. Clean up context files.
2. Update `tasks.md` (move tasks to Done).
3. Commit changes.
4. Verify file integrity.
5. Determine the next rule based on remaining tasks/test status.

## Important Notes

- The effectiveness of the `reuse_terminal` logic should be manually verified if possible, as no automated test covers it specifically.
