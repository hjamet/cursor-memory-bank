# Active Context

## Current Status
- **Last Action**: Re-analyzed persistent permission errors in `install.sh` after previous fixes failed when testing with `curl | bash` in MINGW64.
- **Outcome**: Concluded standard `chmod` commands within loops/conditionals are unreliable in the target environment (`curl | bash` on MINGW64), likely due to shell interpretation issues. The error `: command not found` persists even with minimal `chmod -R u+rw`.
- **Next Step**: Implement a simplified permission strategy in `install.sh`.

## Current Implementation Context
- **Task Section**: Addressing persistent failure from section 1 (Task 1.3 specifically).
- **Task**: Fix persistent permission errors (`: command not found`) in `install.sh` during `curl | bash` on MINGW64.
- **Goal**: Modify the permission setting loop in `install_rules` to avoid the error, likely by removing conditional checks and function calls around the `chmod` command.
- **Impacted Files**: `install.sh`
- **Impacted Symbols**: `install_rules` (permission setting loop).
- **Dependencies**: Bash scripting (`chmod`).
- **Online Research**: Indicated potential issues with conditionals, function calls, and environment inheritance in piped bash scripts on MINGW.
- **Decision**: Simplify the permission loop drastically: remove the `if ! ...` conditional and the `warn` call. Execute `chmod -R u+rw` directly, ignoring potential `chmod` errors (`|| true`) to prioritize avoiding the `: command not found` error caused by the script structure.
