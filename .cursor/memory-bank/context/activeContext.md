# Active Context

## Current Goal
Modify `consolidate-repo.mdc` to perform direct cleanup actions and reorder steps.

## Summary of Fix
- Modified `userbrief-template.mdc`, `consolidate-repo.mdc`, `task-decomposition.mdc` for new task lifecycle (input -> ⏳ -> 🗄️).
- Tested `consult_image` tool.
- Refined format descriptions in `userbrief-template.mdc`.
- Refined example in `task-decomposition.mdc`.
- Modified `consolidate-repo.mdc` to implement direct file cleanup (merge/delete/move) in Step 4 and reordered steps (3->3, 5->4, 4->5, 6->6).
- Updated `consolidate-repo.mdc` example.

## Current implementation context
- Completed all tasks defined for the user requests (rule modifications, refinements, and logic update).
- `tasks.md` contains duplicate completed sections under # ToDo due to prior edit failures, but no pending tasks remain.

## Previous Context (Preserved)
- Workflow completed for the request to implement character-based log handling and fix related test regressions.
- Implemented character-based log retrieval in MCP tools (`logger.js`, tool handlers, `state_manager.js`).
- Verified functionality with ad-hoc tests.
- Fixed regression in `tests/test_consult_image.js` by updating assertion to expect `image/jpeg` (due to intended image processing).
- All automated tests (excluding known issue with `test_mcp_async_terminal.js` run via MCP) now pass.
- Fixed `consult_image` MCP tool (previously crashed on large images).
    - Used `sharp` library for server-side image resizing/compression before base64 encoding.
- Strengthened `experience-execution` rule analysis.
- Modified `experience-execution` rule error handling.
- Verified `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command`.
- Debugged `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error with `mcp-commit-server`.
