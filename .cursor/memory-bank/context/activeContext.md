# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is to validate and improve the new MemoryBank MCP server tools based on user feedback. The previous validation via a test script was insufficient. The new plan is to call each tool directly to provide a hands-on analysis.

## Current implementation context
-   **Tasks to perform**: I am re-doing Task 34: "Systematically Test MCP Memory Bank Tools".
-   **Execution Plan**: I will now call each `mcp_MemoryBank_*` tool sequentially. For each tool, I will display the output and provide a brief analysis of its correctness and format.

## Next Steps
1.  Execute each MemoryBank tool directly.
2.  Document findings in the chat.
3.  Commit the final context updates once the validation is complete.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
- **Tool Schemas**: All tool argument descriptions in `server.js` have been improved.
