# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed**: Addressed user request to test pre-commit hook functionality and mention bypass possibility in the hook message.
- **Test Results**: Automated test successfully verified pre-commit hook blocking (`temp_long_file.py` > 500 lines failed commit) and bypassing (`bypass_hooks: true` allowed commit).
- **Cleanup**: Test artifacts (temporary script, long file) were removed, and the test commit was reset.
- **Status**: All tasks related to pre-commit hook and bypass functionality are complete.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Modified `.githooks/pre-commit` to update the error message.
- Updated `README.md` with manual verification steps (kept for reference, but automated test performed).
- Performed automated test: created script, generated long file, configured hooks, tested commit block & bypass, cleaned up.
- Updated `tasks.md` to reflect task completion via automation.
