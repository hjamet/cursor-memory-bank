# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-6) are üü¢ DONE.
- **Last Action**: Archived a `userbrief.md` item related to the already completed Task 6 (Enhance MCP Commit Tool with Git Log Output). This item was previously marked `‚è≥` and was re-processed by `consolidate-repo` / `request-analysis` before being correctly identified as resolved and archived by `task-decomposition` (with help from `on-edit-tool-fail` for the file modification).
- **Next Steps**: The workflow should now conclude.

*(Historical context and details of previously completed tasks are condensed or omitted for brevity, focusing on the final state of task completion.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Fix Format Violations in `userbrief.md`
    - **Origin**: Detected by `consolidate-repo.mdc` during format checks.
    - **Issue**: Lines 2, 3, and 4 of `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` (currently ` ```text`, ` [...]`, and ` ``` `) do not conform to the expected emoji-prefixed format.
    - **Action**: Remove these three offending lines.
