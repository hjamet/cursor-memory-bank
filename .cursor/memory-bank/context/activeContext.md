# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Test MCP commit server functionality (Task 5.1).
- **Description**: Execute the commit server script (`.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`) using `node` wrapped with the `timeout` command to ensure it starts correctly and doesn't hang. Validate it runs without immediate errors within a 60-second timeout.
- **Impacted Files**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`
- **Relevant Info**: Task originated from `userbrief.md`. Need `node` and `timeout` commands.
- **Attention Points**: Monitor command output for errors. Verify the `timeout` command works as expected (or find alternative if not available).
- **Technical Decisions**: Use `timeout 60s node ...` command structure.

## Previous State Summary
- Verified `mcp-commit-server` functionality and `commit` tool availability.
- Corrected `.cursor/mcp.json` structure.
- Refactored `server.js` initialization in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
- Simplified `fix` rule debugging logic (sequential).
- Refined `fix` rule debugging logic (parallel).
- Completed Memory server update and Install script enhancement tasks.
- Completed `mcp.json` file investigation.
- All tests passed.

## Lost workflow
- **Summary**: Got stuck in a loop between `context-update` and `consolidate-repo` because stale ðŸ”„ tasks persisted in `userbrief.md` despite attempts to remove them. User manually edited `userbrief.md` to fix the inconsistency and invoked `workflow-perdu`.
- **Files/Rules**: `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`, `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`, `context-update`, `consolidate-repo` rules.
