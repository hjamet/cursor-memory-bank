# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Correcting memory file format violations identified by `consolidate-repo`.
    - **Origin**: `consolidate-repo` -> `request-analysis`.
    - **Files to fix**:
        1.  `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`: Summary line (`‚úÖ‚ùå‚ÑπÔ∏è`) needs to be the first non-empty line.
        2.  `.cursor/memory-bank/context/projectBrief.md`: Needs to use H2 sections (`## Vision`, `## Objectives`, etc.) instead of H1 + bolded text.
    - **Guiding Rules**:
        - `test-execution.mdc` for `tests.md` format.
        - `context-loading.mdc` for `projectBrief.md` format.
- **Previous Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) were üü¢ DONE (before this corrective action).
- **Next Steps**: After these corrections, proceed to `context-update`.

*(Historical context is further condensed as all defined tasks are complete.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Outcome**: Successfully modified Step 5 of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts fail, the rule will now interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details. Steps 6-8 were made conditional on edit success.
- **Overall Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) are now üü¢ DONE.
- **Next Steps**: The workflow should now conclude.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (New Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Goal**: Change the behavior of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts (including full rewrite) fail, the rule should interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details and a code block for the changes.
    - **Key Changes to `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`**:
        - Modify Step 5's failure path (after "Full Rewrite" fails).
        - Instead of proceeding to Step 6 (Prepare to Return), it should:
            - Announce that all attempts failed and manual intervention is exceptionally required.
            - State the workflow is interrupted.
            - Provide a message like: "Dans le fichier `[target_file]`, veuillez effectuer les modifications suivantes :"
            - Include a single code block with high-level instructions for the manual edit (e.g., "Replace line X with Y", "Delete lines A-B").
        - Steps 6, 7, and 8 of the rule will likely not be reached in this failure scenario and might need to be implicitly or explicitly bypassed.
    - **Attention Points**: Ensure the language used for the user prompt is clear, emphasizes the exceptional nature, and provides all necessary information for the manual edit.
