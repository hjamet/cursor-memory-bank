# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¢ Task 27 - Add Regex-Based Edit Tool to MyMCP Server (COMPLETED)

### Task 27 Completion Summary
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully completed all objectives.
- **Outcome**: A new `regex_edit` tool has been successfully added to the `MyMCP` server. This tool provides a fallback mechanism for file editing when standard tools fail, by allowing targeted replacements based on regular expressions.

### Upcoming Tasks Overview
- **Task 28**: Update on-edit-tool-fail rule to use new regex tool.
- **Task 29**: Enhance recall tool with long-term memory database.

### Dependencies and Workflow
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks 23-24 depend on Task 22 completion (âœ…)
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks 28-29 can be developed independently
- **Major Redesign**: Task 26 represents complete workflow system overhaul

## Technical Implementation Status

### MemoryBank MCP Server Current State
- **Total Tools**: 10 tools (9 original + `remember` tool)
- **New Tools**: read_memory, edit_memory, remember (all fully functional)
- **Server Status**: âœ… Starts successfully with all tools registered
- **Registration Format**: âœ… Proper 3-parameter format maintained
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may require Cursor restart (documented issue)

### Memory Management Tools Specifications
- **read_memory**: Takes context_file enum, returns complete content with metadata
- **edit_memory**: Takes context_file enum + content, completely replaces existing content
- **remember**: Takes past, present, future strings and stores them in a capped JSON log.
- **File Path Mapping**: activeContext, projectBrief, techContext â†’ corresponding .md files
- **Error Handling**: Validates file names, handles missing files with clear suggestions

## Recent Achievements
- **Task 27**: âœ… `regex_edit` tool successfully implemented and added to MyMCP server.
- **Task 26**: âœ… MCP-based workflow system is functional.
- **Task 24**: âœ… All workflow rules successfully refactored to use MemoryBank MCP tools.
- **Task 23**: âœ… `remember` tool successfully implemented and tested.
- **Task 22**: âœ… Memory management tools successfully implemented and tested.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation documentation created.
- **Testing**: 100% success rate across all test scenarios.
- **Code Quality**: All files pass syntax validation and follow established patterns.
- **Integration**: Tools ready for use in workflow rule updates (Task 24).

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Proceed to Task 28 (Update `on-edit-tool-fail` rule).
2. **Short-term**: Enhance the recall mechanism with long-term memory (Task 29).
3. **Future**: Explore further enhancements to the workflow system.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
- **Tool Migration**: Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank.
- **Configuration**: `.cursor/mcp.json` properly configured for both servers.

## Recent Learnings
- **Rule Refactoring**: Large-scale refactoring of rules is possible and improves system architecture.
- **MCP Tool Development**: Established patterns for creating new MCP tools with proper error handling.
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suites validate all functionality before integration.
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may not appear immediately due to client-side caching.
- **Documentation Value**: Detailed documentation essential for complex implementations.
- **Modular Design**: Following established patterns ensures consistency and maintainability.
