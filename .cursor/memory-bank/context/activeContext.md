# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MyMCP Tool Investigation
- **Current Task:** Investigate local `mcp-commit-server/server.js` (related to Task 1.1)
- **Goal:** Determine if the failures of MyMCP tools are caused by issues within the local `server.js` script identified in `.cursor/mcp.json`.
- **Problem Context:** MyMCP tools (`execute_command`, `get_terminal_status`) fail consistently. `.cursor/mcp.json` shows these tools rely on `node .cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
- **Next Steps:**
    1. Check if dependencies are installed (`node_modules` in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/`).
    2. Attempt to run the server script directly (`node server.js`) from its directory to check for startup errors.
    3. Examine `server.js` code for potential bugs related to MCP communication or command handling.
- **Dependencies:** Node.js environment, potentially `npm` for dependency installation.

## Current Status

- Identified that MyMCP failures likely stem from the local `mcp-commit-server/server.js` script, not an external server.
- Task 1.1, while listed as Blocked, is now being actively investigated locally.

## Lost workflow

- User invoked `workflow-perdu` and `continue`, prompting re-evaluation of the blocked state.
- Workflow restarted from `context-update`, leading back to `implementation` to investigate the local server script.
