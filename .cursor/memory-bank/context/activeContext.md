# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed**: Implemented pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) to check file lengths (max 500 lines). Modified `install.sh` to install it. Modified `fix.mdc` and `context-update.mdc` to handle the hook's error message and create refactoring tasks in `tasks.md`.
- **Test Results**: 
    - `test_install.sh`, `test_download.sh`, `test_git_install.sh` passed.
    - `test_curl_install.sh` failed as expected (404 fetching hook script, which is not yet in remote master).
    - No unexpected regressions detected.
