# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¢ Memory Bank MCP Server Implementation - COMPLETED
- **Task 12**: Memory Bank MCP Server creation and integration has been successfully completed and committed to the repository
- **Status**: Fully implemented, tested, integrated, and committed (commit 273ab9b)
- **Key Achievements**:
    1. **Complete Server Implementation**: Created full MCP server with modular architecture
    2. **Core Tools Implemented**:
        - `read-userbrief`: Retrieves current/pending tasks and configurable archived entries (default 3)
        - `update-userbrief`: Updates task status (pending, archived, or add comments) with auto-detection
    3. **Full Integration**: Successfully integrated into install.sh script and mcp.json configuration
    4. **Production Ready**: Server tested, validated, and committed to repository

## Recent Accomplishments
- **Memory Bank MCP Server**: Complete implementation from scratch following MyMCP patterns
- **Repository Integration**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 273ab9b)
- **Installation Process**: Updated install.sh to include memory-bank-mcp server installation
- **Configuration**: Added MemoryBankMCP to mcp.json with proper node command configuration

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Memory Bank MCP Location**: `.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/`
- **Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, express, cors, express-rate-limit, zod
- **Tools**: read-userbrief, update-userbrief with comprehensive error handling
- **Configuration**: Integrated as "MemoryBankMCP" in mcp.json
- **Installation**: Fully automated via install.sh with dependency management

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any user feedback on the new Memory Bank MCP server
- Consider additional tools for rule system operations if needed
- Respond to new user requests as they arise

## Previously Completed Task: ðŸŸ¢ 11. Simplify Workflow Rules and Merge Request-Analysis with Task-Decomposition
- **Origin**: User request to simplify the rule system workflow.
- **Outcome**: Successfully streamlined the workflow by simplifying `implementation.mdc` decision logic and merging `request-analysis` functionality into `task-decomposition`. This reduces complexity and improves efficiency while maintaining all essential functionality.
- **Key Changes Implemented**:
    1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Simplified decision logic by moving all next rule calling exclusively to Step 5. Agent now completes all sub-tasks first, then decides between `experience-execution` (default) or `context-update` (rare cases with no executable code changes).
    2. **`task-decomposition.mdc`**: Enhanced with comprehensive analysis capabilities including request analysis, code analysis with codebase search (max 3), research with Context7 tools or web search (max 5), and vision storage functionality. Removed tree creation step while preserving all existing task decomposition functionality.
    3. **Rule References**: Updated all references to `request-analysis` with `task-decomposition` in affected rules: `consolidate-repo.mdc`, `context-loading.mdc`, `fix.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, `system.mdc`, `workflow-perdu.mdc`, `new-chat.mdc`.
    4. **Cleanup**: Deleted obsolete `request-analysis.mdc` file after successful migration.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**: All completed successfully
- **Technical Decisions**: Prioritized workflow simplicity and efficiency over granular separation of concerns while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Implementation Context
- **Current Status**: All major tasks completed, repository up-to-date
- **Recent Commit**: 273ab9b - Complete Memory Bank MCP Server Implementation
- **Next Focus**: Workflow maintenance and new user requests as they arise

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Optimized testing logic in rule system to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` (Task 10).
- Enhanced `fix.mdc` with Git log search for mysterious problems (Task 9).
- Enhanced `context-update` to add agent comments to archived `userbrief.md` tasks (Task 8).
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7).
- Completed major refactoring of memory bank file formats and commit message generation (Tasks 1-6).
