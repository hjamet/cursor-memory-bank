# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¡ Task 13 - Enhance Memory Bank MCP Server with Task Management Tools and JSON Migration
- **Task**: Extend the existing Memory Bank MCP server to include comprehensive task management tools and migrate tasks.md to JSON format
- **Status**: In Progress - Starting implementation
- **Key Objectives**:
    1. **JSON Schema Design**: Create structured JSON format for tasks with auto-generated IDs, dependencies, and status tracking
    2. **Task Manager Library**: Implement comprehensive task management operations (CRUD, dependency validation, querying)
    3. **MCP Tools Implementation**: Create four new tools (create_task, update-task, get_next_tasks, get_all_tasks)
    4. **Migration Strategy**: Convert existing markdown tasks to JSON while preserving all information and relationships

## Technical Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Design JSON schema and create task manager library foundation
- **Phase 2**: Implement individual MCP tools with proper validation and error handling
- **Phase 3**: Create migration script to convert existing tasks.md to JSON format
- **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing and validation of all new functionality

## Key Dependencies and Attention Points
- **Existing Memory Bank MCP Server**: Must build upon the current functional server without breaking existing userbrief tools
- **JSON Schema Requirements**: ID auto-generation, dependency arrays, status mapping from emoji system
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensure task dependencies reference valid existing tasks
- **Data Integrity**: Migration must preserve all existing task information, relationships, and history
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation for all operations, especially dependency management

## Technical Decisions to Make
- **ID Generation Strategy**: Sequential integers vs UUIDs vs timestamp-based IDs
- **Dependency Resolution**: How to handle circular dependencies and validation timing
- **Status Mapping**: Convert emoji-based status system to JSON-compatible status strings
- **File Management**: Whether to maintain both tasks.md and tasks.json or fully migrate
- **Backward Compatibility**: How to handle rules that currently read tasks.md format

## Recent Accomplishments
- **Memory Bank MCP Server**: Complete implementation from scratch following MyMCP patterns
- **Repository Integration**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 273ab9b)
- **Installation Process**: Updated install.sh to include memory-bank-mcp server installation
- **Configuration**: Added MemoryBankMCP to mcp.json with proper node command configuration

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Memory Bank MCP Location**: `.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/`
- **Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, express, cors, express-rate-limit, zod
- **Tools**: read-userbrief, update-userbrief with comprehensive error handling
- **Configuration**: Integrated as "MemoryBankMCP" in mcp.json
- **Installation**: Fully automated via install.sh with dependency management

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any user feedback on the new Memory Bank MCP server
- Consider additional tools for rule system operations if needed
- Respond to new user requests as they arise

## Previously Completed Task: ðŸŸ¢ 11. Simplify Workflow Rules and Merge Request-Analysis with Task-Decomposition
- **Origin**: User request to simplify the rule system workflow.
- **Outcome**: Successfully streamlined the workflow by simplifying `implementation.mdc` decision logic and merging `request-analysis` functionality into `task-decomposition`. This reduces complexity and improves efficiency while maintaining all essential functionality.
- **Key Changes Implemented**:
    1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Simplified decision logic by moving all next rule calling exclusively to Step 5. Agent now completes all sub-tasks first, then decides between `experience-execution` (default) or `context-update` (rare cases with no executable code changes).
    2. **`task-decomposition.mdc`**: Enhanced with comprehensive analysis capabilities including request analysis, code analysis with codebase search (max 3), research with Context7 tools or web search (max 5), and vision storage functionality. Removed tree creation step while preserving all existing task decomposition functionality.
    3. **Rule References**: Updated all references to `request-analysis` with `task-decomposition` in affected rules: `consolidate-repo.mdc`, `context-loading.mdc`, `fix.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, `system.mdc`, `workflow-perdu.mdc`, `new-chat.mdc`.
    4. **Cleanup**: Deleted obsolete `request-analysis.mdc` file after successful migration.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**: All completed successfully
- **Technical Decisions**: Prioritized workflow simplicity and efficiency over granular separation of concerns while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Implementation Context
- **Current Status**: All major tasks completed, repository up-to-date
- **Recent Commit**: 273ab9b - Complete Memory Bank MCP Server Implementation
- **Next Focus**: Workflow maintenance and new user requests as they arise

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Optimized testing logic in rule system to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` (Task 10).
- Enhanced `fix.mdc` with Git log search for mysterious problems (Task 9).
- Enhanced `context-update` to add agent comments to archived `userbrief.md` tasks (Task 8).
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7).
- Completed major refactoring of memory bank file formats and commit message generation (Tasks 1-6).
