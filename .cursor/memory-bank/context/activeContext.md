# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** Rule Refactoring / MCP Integration
- **Current Task:** Modify rules (`context-update`, `consolidate-repo`, `experience-execution`, `request-analysis`, `fix`) to consistently use MCP tools for command execution (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` instead of `run_terminal_cmd` or direct commands like `find`, `rm`) and update `request-analysis` to recommend `mcp_Context7_*`.
- **Goal:** Ensure all rules adhere to the project standard of using MCP tools for external interactions and provide better guidance for library research.
- **Last Actions:** Completed `request-analysis` which identified the specific rules and modifications needed.
- **Files:** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (specifically those listed above)

## Current Status

- User confirmed MCP server stability and abandoned `mcp_send_input` development.
- Workflow restarted, `context-loading` and `consolidate-repo` completed.
- Analysis complete, ready for implementation.

## Recent Decisions

- Prioritize updating rules to use MCP tools based on user request/preferences.

## Next Steps

- Implement the identified changes to the rule files.
- Call `context-update` after modifications as these are non-testable rule edits.

## Important Notes

- Ensure MCP command syntax is correct (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command(command="...")`).
- Update rule descriptions and examples where necessary to reflect MCP tool usage.
- MCP output capture might be unreliable for quick commands, especially Python.

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `tasks.md` (No dedicated tasks yet, working directly from analysis)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Files to Modify:**
    - `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/consolidate-repo.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/request-analysis.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/fix.mdc`
- **Key Functions/Classes:** N/A (Rule file text modifications)

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A
- **Relevant Tests:** N/A (Changes are to non-testable rule files)

## Documentation Context
