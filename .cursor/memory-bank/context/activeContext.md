# Active Context

## Lost workflow
- **Reason:** Used `run_terminal_cmd` instead of `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` to test the Python script after modifying the MCP server. Invoked `workflow-perdu` as requested by the user.
- **Actions performed:** 
    - Analyzed MCP server output capture issues for short-lived processes.
    - Researched `spawn` behavior, race conditions, and stream events (`end`, `finish`).
    - Modified `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` to wait for `end` events on child streams before `finish` events on log file streams.
    - Reverted `get_terminal_output` to prioritize reading initially captured output from state for finished processes.
    - Tested the fix using `run_terminal_cmd` (incorrectly) instead of `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
    - The test *appeared* successful (output captured), but the wrong tool was used.
- **Files/Symbols involved:** `test_mcp.py`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` (specifically `execute_command`, `get_terminal_output`), `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
- **Conclusion:** The MCP server code modification seems to work, but needs to be tested correctly using the `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` tool.

- Identified an issue where the terminal status update for short-lived commands was delayed.
- Analyzed `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` and found the delay was caused by waiting for stream finalization before updating the state in the `handleExit` function.
- Modified the `handleExit` function in `process_manager.js` to perform an immediate status update upon process exit, followed by a secondary update for final details after stream closure.
- User requested to test this fix directly using MCP commands before proceeding with automated tests.

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Server Refactoring
- **Current Task:** Refactor `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` into modular components (`lib/*`, `mcp_tools/*`) to improve maintainability, reliability, and simplify command execution logic, while preserving MCP tool interfaces.
- **Goal:** A clean, modular, reliable, and general implementation of the MCP command execution tools.
- **Last Actions:** Completed Request Analysis and Task Decomposition, defining the steps in `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`.
- **Files/Modules Involved:**
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` (Source & Target)
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/` (Target Directory)
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/` (Target Directory)
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/terminals_status.json` (State File)
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/logs/` (Log Directory)
    - `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` (Test File)
- **Key Logic:**
    - Extracting state management (`state_manager.js`), logging (`logger.js`), and process spawning/output capture (`process_manager.js`) into `lib/`.
    - Moving individual tool handlers (`commit`, `execute_command`, etc.) into `mcp_tools/`.
    - Ensuring `process_manager.js` reliably captures all stdout/stderr using ESM and async patterns (handling `data`, `exit`, `close`, `error` events).
    - Updating main `server.js` to use imports and delegate to the new modules.
    - Maintaining exact MCP tool signatures.
    - Using `run_terminal_cmd` for testing during implementation.

## Current Status

- Workflow started, `context-loading`, `request-analysis`, and `task-decomposition` completed.
- Ready to begin implementation based on tasks in `tasks.md` (Section 1).

## Recent Decisions

- Confirmed use of ES Modules (ESM) for the refactored code based on existing `server.js` and Node.js best practices.
- Prioritize reliable output capture in `process_manager.js` by handling stream events correctly.

## Next Steps

- Implement tasks from Section 1 of `tasks.md`, starting with 1.1 (Create Directory Structure and Files).

## Important Notes

- Adhere strictly to existing MCP tool signatures.
- Use `run_terminal_cmd` (not the MCP tool) for running tests (`tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`) until refactoring is complete and verified.
