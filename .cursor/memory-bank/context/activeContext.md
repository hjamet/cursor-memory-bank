# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed**: Implemented file-based logging in `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` and updated the `fix` rule to read the log file.
- **Outcome**: Unexpectedly, adding file logging caused `test_mcp_async_terminal.js` to pass during the automated run. The exact reason is unclear but likely related to altered stdio behavior or timing.
- **Status**: All tests now pass.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Implemented file logging in `test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
- Updated `fix.mdc` rule to read the test log file on failure.
- Test suite now passes, including the previously failing `test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
