# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: None currently active. All tasks completed.
- **Status**: Workflow appears complete pending final checks.
- **Description**: Completed Task 5.1 (Test MCP commit server functionality) by correcting import paths in `server.js` based on SDK documentation.
- **Impacted Files**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`
- **Dependencies**: Node.js v22.14.0.
- **Relevant Info**: Tests passed after the fix.

## Previous State Summary
- Completed Task 5.1 (Test MCP commit server functionality).
- Corrected `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` imports in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
- Confirmed tests pass after fix.
- Corrected `.cursor/mcp.json` structure.
- Refactored `server.js` initialization in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
- Simplified `fix` rule debugging logic (sequential).
- Refined `fix` rule debugging logic (parallel).
- Completed Memory server update and Install script enhancement tasks.
- Completed `mcp.json` file investigation.
- All tests passed.
- Ran `npm ci` in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/` attempting to fix SDK installation.

## Lost workflow

I previously concluded the Node.js environment was unstable due to failures in getting `node --version` via the terminal tool. The user clarified that Node v22.14.0 is installed and working correctly, indicating the version check failure was likely a terminal tool bug. This invalidates the previous conclusion that the workflow was blocked by the Node environment.

The actual blocker is the `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` error when trying to run `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`. This occurred even after reinstalling dependencies with `npm ci`. The error suggests Node cannot resolve the main import from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` using its `package.json` `exports` map.

Plan is to restart the implementation of Task 5.1, focusing on diagnosing this specific error by examining `server.js` and the SDK's `package.json` again.

Relevant files/symbols:
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/package.json`
