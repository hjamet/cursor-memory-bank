# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Finalizing user requests regarding rule and script modifications.
- **Current Task**: Committing implemented changes and checking workflow status.
  - **Logic**: Update context, move tasks to Done, commit changes, check file integrity and tests/tasks status.
  - **Dependencies**: None.
  - **Attention Points**: Use MCP tools for commit and commands.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Rule `fix.mdc` enhanced with optional Git history check for regressions.
- Script `install.sh` improved to clean `.cursor/mcp` directory before MCP server installation.
- Rule `architect.mdc` simplified, refactored to Markdown, and enforces mandatory context/git log checks.
- `tasks.md` updated with new tasks and marked current ones as completed.
- Previous changes might have been reverted, hence re-implementing these modifications.
- All tests are now passing.
- Changes successfully committed (Commit: 9b5a48ed...), despite MCP tool reporting failure due to hook output.
