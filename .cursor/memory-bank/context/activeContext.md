# Active Context

## Current Goal
Completed verification and cleanup of `tasks.md` "In Progress" section.

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Tasks**:
    - Verified that Task 2.1 (Investigate Python Output Capture) was previously resolved.
    - Verified that Task 3.1 (Enhance `mcp_execute_command`) was resolved by recent implementation.
- **Summary**: Reviewed tasks in `# In Progress` section of `tasks.md`. Confirmed both tasks were already addressed by prior work. Updated `tasks.md` to move these tasks to `# Done`.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`
- **Next Steps**: Commit documentation changes and check final workflow status.

## Lost workflow
- **Trigger**: User invoked `workflow-perdu.mdc`.
- **Last Actions**: Completed analysis of failing tests listed in `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`.
    - Confirmed `MCP Python Execution Test` now passes due to previous universal Git Bash execution fix in `process_manager.js`. Updated `tests.md` status to ✅.
    - Identified `MCP Async Terminal Workflow` test (`tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`) as invalid when run via MCP due to nested server conflict. Updated `tests.md` status to ⚠️ with explanation.
- **Files involved**: `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
- **Likely Workflow Phase**: Concluding the `fix` rule after analyzing and updating test statuses.
# Active Context

## Current Goal
Verify and clean up remaining tasks in the "In Progress" section of `tasks.md`.

## Current implementation context
- **High Priority Tasks**:
    - `2.1 Investigate Python Output Capture`: Verify if this was resolved by previous fixes (universal Git Bash execution).
    - `3.1 Enhance mcp_execute_command`: Verify if this was resolved by the recent implementation of immediate result return.
- **Plan**: 
    - For 2.1: Confirm Python output capture works based on previous `fix` rule testing (MCP Python Execution Test passed). Mark as done.
    - For 3.1: Confirm the description matches the feature just implemented (immediate return on early completion). Mark as done.
- **Files Involved**:
    - `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`
- **Next Steps**: Update `tasks.md` based on verification.
