# Active Context

## Current Goal
Consolidate repository state after fixing the `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` working directory issue.

## Current implementation context
- **Fix Applied**: Modified `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` to prepend `cd "${projectRoot}" &&` to the command string executed by `bash.exe -c` on Windows.
- **Result**: Commands executed via `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` now correctly start in the workspace root directory on Windows, resolving issues with relative paths.
- **Verification**: Confirmed with `pwd` and `cat ./relative_file.txt` commands via MCP, which succeeded.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (updated).
- **Status**: Fix implemented and validated.
- **Next Steps**: Commit changes and continue workflow.
