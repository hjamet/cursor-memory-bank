# Active Context

## Current Focus
All planned tasks are complete. Awaiting new user requests.

## Recent Decisions
- **Completed Userbrief Refactoring in Rules**: Successfully refactored `consolidate-repo.mdc` and `task-decomposition.mdc` to use the `read-userbrief` and `update-userbrief` MCP tools. This completes the migration to a JSON-based userbrief system, fully decoupling the workflow from direct file I/O on the old `.md` file (Task 31).
- **Deleted `userbrief.md`**: After confirming that no rules depended on it anymore, the legacy `userbrief.md` file was permanently deleted.

## Next Steps
1.  **Immediate**: Await new user requests to be added to `userbrief.json`.
2.  **Future**: Continue improving the agent's autonomy and capabilities based on new tasks.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`. The old `userbrief.md` has been deleted.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
