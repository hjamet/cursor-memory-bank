# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MyMCP Tool Investigation
- **Current Task:** Context update after failed diagnostic (Task 1.1).
- **Goal:** Document the outcome of the diagnostic attempt and the blocked state.
- **Problem Context:** Diagnostic attempts showed that `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` and `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status` consistently fail with "Error: no result from tool", regardless of parameters (`timeout`, command type). This indicates a general failure of the MyMCP server or its connection.
- **Next Steps:** The task (1.1) is marked as Blocked. Requires external intervention on the MyMCP server.
- **Dependencies:** A functional MyMCP server.

## Current Status

- Diagnostic complete (as far as possible). MyMCP server tools (`execute_command`, `get_terminal_status`) are non-functional.
- Task 1.1 moved to Blocked in `tasks.md`.
