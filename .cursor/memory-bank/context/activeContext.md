## Current Goal
Commit changes after attempting to fix Python output capture.

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Fix Python output capture in MCP server.
- **Status**: Blocked/Failed.
- **Summary**: Despite extensive attempts (spawn/execa, shell true/false, -u flag, PYTHONUNBUFFERED, temp file redirection), stdout/stderr cannot be captured from Python processes on Windows via Node.js in this environment. Output capture *does* work for non-Python commands (`echo`). This strongly suggests an environment-specific issue (Python install, PATH, permissions, security software, OS/Node bug) preventing stream redirection/capture for Python subprocesses.
- **Final Code State**: `process_manager.js` was refactored to use `execa` with `shell: true` and default buffering as the most robust general approach, but this did not resolve the Python-specific issue.
- **Recommendation**: Requires external investigation of the execution environment.
- **Key Files Involved**:
    - `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (Refactored to use execa)
    - `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` (Task marked as blocked)

## Lost workflow

- Identified that `npm install`
