# Active Context

## Current Focus
The autonomous workflow system is operating in production mode with 3 active tasks. Recent critical fixes have been successfully completed, including the resolution of a major data loss bug in Gemini CLI integration (Task #275, now APPROVED). One implementation is completed and awaiting validation.

## Current Active Tasks Context

### Task #280 (Priority 3): URL to Markdown Conversion Tool
**Status**: REVIEW - Implementation completed, awaiting validation
**Context**: User request for a new MCP tool that converts web pages to Markdown format
**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `url_to_markdown.js` with exact MCP pattern compliance
- ✅ Integrated Puppeteer + Turndown for web extraction and HTML→Markdown conversion
- ✅ Registered tool in server.js with proper Zod schema
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and automatic resource cleanup
- ✅ External test script created for validation

**Critical Requirements Met**: 
- ✅ Follows existing MCP Tools patterns exactly
- ✅ No general tool descriptions (avoids parsing problems)
- ✅ External test script for validation (Cursor restart limitation handled)

**Validation Pending**:
- Manual installation of `turndown` dependency
- External script testing
- Cursor restart for MCP tool activation

### Task #281 (Priority 2): Gemini CLI Configuration Architecture Fix  
**Status**: TODO - Largely resolved by #275 fixes, final validation needed
**Context**: Correction of fundamental architecture error in Gemini CLI integration
**Background**: User corrected that script should modify `.gemini/settings.json` (local) not `~/.gemini/settings.json` (global)

**Current State**: 
- ✅ Main architectural error FIXED during #275 data loss corrections
- ✅ Local configuration (.gemini/settings.json) now implemented
- ✅ Data preservation logic fully functional
- ⚠️ Final validation needed: Confirm Gemini CLI reads local configurations

### Task #282 (Priority 4): Implementation Rule Architecture Correction
**Status**: TODO - Critical workflow refactoring
**Context**: User-requested correction to implementation.md rule for intelligent routing
**Requirements**:
- Add intelligent routing logic to distinguish execution vs development tasks
- Route pure execution tasks directly to experience-execution
- Remove forbidden step 4 (REVIEW status change)
- Maintain automatic transition to experience-execution

**Critical Risks Identified**:
- Classification system fragility (keyword-based routing)
- Workflow architecture disruption potential
- Maintenance complexity increase
- Error detection gaps if routing fails

## Recent Critical Achievements

### Task #275 Data Loss Bug Resolution (APPROVED)
**Critical Fix Completed**: Successfully resolved catastrophic data loss bug in `configure_gemini_cli_mcp()` function
**Problems Solved**:
1. **Data Loss Prevention**: Fixed `existing_config=$(cat file)` + `cat > file` anti-pattern
2. **Architecture Correction**: Changed from global (~/.gemini/settings.json) to local (.gemini/settings.json) 
3. **JSON Generation**: Eliminated double closing braces causing truncation

**Technical Implementation**:
- Intelligent JSON merging with jq (primary) and manual fallback
- Robust Windows path handling and escaping
- Complete preservation of existing user configurations
- Comprehensive error handling and user warnings

### Experience-Execution Critical Analysis (Task #280)
**Analysis Completed**: Adverse testing revealed critical robustness weaknesses in URL→Markdown implementation
**Weaknesses Identified**:
1. URL validation absent (malformed URLs crash Puppeteer)
2. Title handling fragile (undefined produces "undefined" in output)
3. Dependency validation missing (turndown availability not checked)
4. Timeout configuration rigid (30s may be insufficient)
5. Content selectors fragile (empty content possible)

**Status**: Implementation architecturally correct but requires robustness fixes

## Current System State

### Technical Health
- **Task Completion Rate**: 99.3% (269/272 tasks completed - CORRECTED)
- **Active Tasks**: 3 tasks (1 REVIEW, 2 TODO)
- **System Stability**: Autonomous workflow operating reliably
- **Data Integrity**: All validation systems operational
- **Repository State**: Clean, optimized, selective Git synchronization active

### Workflow Architecture Status
- **Implementation Phase**: Cannot mark tasks as REVIEW/DONE (forbidden by architecture)
- **Experience-Execution**: Has exclusive responsibility for task completion
- **Validation Pipeline**: 3-layer validation system fully operational
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent storage with automatic cleanup functional

## Technical Context

### MCP Server Infrastructure
- **MemoryBankMCP**: Core workflow and data management (operational)
- **ToolsMCP**: System operations (URL→Markdown tool implemented, pending activation)
- **Context7**: Documentation integration (configured)

### Recent Architectural Decisions
- **Local Configuration Pattern**: Gemini CLI uses project-local .gemini/settings.json
- **Data Preservation Strategy**: Intelligent merging with fallback for configuration files
- **Testing Approach**: External scripts for MCP tool validation (Cursor restart limitation)
- **Robustness Requirements**: All MCP tools must handle edge cases gracefully

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Critical**: Fix robustness issues in Task #280 (URL validation, error handling)
2. **High**: Complete Task #281 final validation of Gemini CLI local configuration
3. **Medium**: Implement Task #282 (implementation rule architecture correction)
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain context files accuracy as system evolves

## Implementation Constraints

### Technical Limitations
- **MCP Tool Testing**: Cannot test directly, requires external scripts
- **Cursor Restart**: Required for MCP server changes (manual process)
- **Pattern Compliance**: Critical for MCP tool integration success
- **Robustness Standard**: All tools must handle malformed inputs gracefully

### Quality Standards
- **Error Prevention**: User emphasized tendency to make errors, extra validation required
- **Pattern Adherence**: Must follow existing code patterns exactly
- **Data Safety**: All configuration changes must preserve existing user data
- **Production Readiness**: All implementations must be robust enough for production use

## Repository Technical State
- **Git Performance**: Optimized, <1 second operations
- **File Tracking**: Selective synchronization (.cursor/memory-bank/context/ and workflow/ only)
- **Cleanup Status**: Repository maintained clean, temporary files removed
- **Validation Systems**: All data integrity checks active and operational
