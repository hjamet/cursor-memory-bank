# Active Context

## Current Goal
Consolidate repository state after fixing the immediate result issue in `execute_command`.

## Current implementation context
- **Previous Fix**: Addressed the issue where `execute_command` didn't immediately return `status`/`exit_code` for fast-finishing commands.
    - **Root Cause**: Relied on fetching state after completion, which had timing issues.
    - **Fix**: Modified `terminal_execution.js` to directly use the `{ code, signal }` resolved by `completionPromise`.
    - **Verification**: Tests confirmed the fix.
- **Consolidation**: Performed `consolidate-repo` rule:
    - Cleaned processed items in `userbrief.md`.
    - Verified memory file integrity.
    - Cleaned up finished MCP terminal processes.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js`, `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`.
- **Status**: Fix implemented and committed. Repository consolidated.
- **Next Steps**: Complete context update and determine next workflow step.
