# Active Context

## Current Goal
Modify workflow rules (`consolidate-repo.mdc`, `task-decomposition.mdc`) and `userbrief-template.mdc` to implement a new task lifecycle (input -> processing ‚è≥ -> archives üóÑÔ∏è) in `userbrief.md`, following the specified rename-edit-rename procedure.

## Summary of Fix
- Modified `userbrief-template.mdc` to add `# Archives` section.
- Modified `consolidate-repo.mdc` to handle input -> processing (‚è≥).
- Modified `task-decomposition.mdc` to handle processing (‚è≥) -> tasks.md -> archives (üóÑÔ∏è).
- Followed rename-edit-rename procedure for `.mdc` files.

## Current implementation context
- Completed rule modifications (Task section 1 in `tasks.md`).
- Next task section is "2. Tool Testing", specifically task 2.1: Test `consult_image` tool.

## Previous Context (Preserved)
- Workflow completed for the request to implement character-based log handling and fix related test regressions.
- Implemented character-based log retrieval in MCP tools (`logger.js`, tool handlers, `state_manager.js`).
- Verified functionality with ad-hoc tests.
- Fixed regression in `tests/test_consult_image.js` by updating assertion to expect `image/jpeg` (due to intended image processing).
- All automated tests (excluding known issue with `test_mcp_async_terminal.js` run via MCP) now pass.
- Fixed `consult_image` MCP tool (previously crashed on large images).
    - Used `sharp` library for server-side image resizing/compression before base64 encoding.
- Strengthened `experience-execution` rule analysis.
- Modified `experience-execution` rule error handling.
- Verified `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command`.
- Debugged `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error with `mcp-commit-server`.
