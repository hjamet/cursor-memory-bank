# Active Context

## Current Status
- **Last Action**: Executed tests using `tests/test_install.sh`.
- **Outcome**: All tests passed successfully.
- **Observations**: 
    - `jq` dependency warning occurred (expected if `jq` not installed). Installation proceeds without it.
    - `command not found` errors on lines 454/455 of `install.sh` during permission setting. Non-blocking for tests, but noted in `tests.md` for investigation.
- **Next Step**: Update context, cleanup, commit changes.

## Current Implementation Context
- **Task**: Modify `install.sh` to download `server.js` during `curl` installation.
- **Goal**: Ensure the `curl` installation method correctly downloads all necessary server files, including `server.js` for the commit server.
- **Status**: Analyzing `install.sh` to locate insertion point.
- **Impacted Files**: `install.sh`
- **Impacted Symbols**: `install_rules` function
