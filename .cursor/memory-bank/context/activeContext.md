# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Implement user requests from the latest `userbrief.md` processing.
- **Current Tasks (from tasks.md)**:
    - All tasks completed.
- **Dependencies**: N/A.
- **Attention Points**: Pre-commit hook correctly warns about `install.sh` length and allows commit, but `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool incorrectly reports failure due to hook output.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Rules `fix` and `architect` modified according to userbrief.
- `install.sh` updated with corrected MCP cleanup logic.
- Attempt to implement `consult_pdf` was cancelled.
- Fix cycle completed: Resolved regressions in installation and async terminal tests.
- All tests are now passing.
- Changes successfully committed (Commit: 9b5a48ed...), despite MCP tool reporting failure due to hook output.
