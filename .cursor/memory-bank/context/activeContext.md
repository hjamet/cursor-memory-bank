# Active Context

## Lost workflow
- **Reason:** Used `run_terminal_cmd` instead of `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` to test the Python script after modifying the MCP server. Invoked `workflow-perdu` as requested by the user.
- **Actions performed:** 
    - Analyzed MCP server output capture issues for short-lived processes.
    - Researched `spawn` behavior, race conditions, and stream events (`end`, `finish`).
    - Modified `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` to wait for `end` events on child streams before `finish` events on log file streams.
    - Reverted `get_terminal_output` to prioritize reading initially captured output from state for finished processes.
    - Tested the fix using `run_terminal_cmd` (incorrectly) instead of `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
    - The test *appeared* successful (output captured), but the wrong tool was used.
- **Files/Symbols involved:** `test_mcp.py`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js` (specifically `execute_command`, `get_terminal_output`), `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
- **Conclusion:** The MCP server code modification seems to work, but needs to be tested correctly using the `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` tool.

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** Rule Refactoring / MCP Integration
- **Current Task:** Modify rules (`context-update`, `consolidate-repo`, `experience-execution`, `request-analysis`, `fix`) to consistently use MCP tools for command execution (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` instead of `run_terminal_cmd` or direct commands like `find`, `rm`) and update `request-analysis` to recommend `mcp_Context7_*`.
- **Goal:** Ensure all rules adhere to the project standard of using MCP tools for external interactions and provide better guidance for library research.
- **Last Actions:** Completed `request-analysis` which identified the specific rules and modifications needed.
- **Files:** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (specifically those listed above)

## Current Status

- User confirmed MCP server stability and abandoned `mcp_send_input` development.
- Workflow restarted, `context-loading` and `consolidate-repo` completed.
- Analysis complete, ready for implementation.

## Recent Decisions

- Prioritize updating rules to use MCP tools based on user request/preferences.

## Next Steps

- Implement the identified changes to the rule files.
- Call `context-update` after modifications as these are non-testable rule edits.

## Important Notes

- Ensure MCP command syntax is correct (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command(command="...")`).
- Update rule descriptions and examples where necessary to reflect MCP tool usage.
- MCP output capture might be unreliable for quick commands, especially Python.
