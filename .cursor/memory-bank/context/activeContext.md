# Active Context

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Corrected memory file format violations (tests.md, projectBrief.md) based on `consolidate-repo` and `request-analysis`.
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7), including changes to Step 5 and conditionalizing Steps 6-8. Details of this change (New Task 7 goal, key changes, attention points) are preserved in historical logs if needed, but condensed here for active context brevity.

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Task**: üü¢ **8. Enhance `context-update` to Comment on Archived Userbrief Tasks**
    - **Origin**: User request, processed through `consolidate-repo` and `task-decomposition`.
    - **Outcome**: Modified `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc` to add a new step (New Step 3: Userbrief Archival Commenting). This step reads `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`, identifies archived tasks (üóÑÔ∏è), checks this `activeContext.md` for "memory" of processing related tasks (by searching for the first 30 chars of the archived task description within this file), and if remembered and not already commented, appends `-> üß† Task context found in active memory.` to the task in `userbrief.md`.
    - **Sub-Tasks Status**:
        - üü¢ **8.1. Design `context-update` New Step Logic**: Completed.
        - üü¢ **8.2. Implement `context-update` Modification**: Completed.
        - üü¢ **8.3. Test Commenting Feature**: Logic implemented in the rule; will be implicitly tested during subsequent workflow executions when the modified `context-update` rule runs.
    - **Next Steps**: The modified `context-update` rule will now execute its new Step 3 as part of this current `context-update` execution.

*(This file reflects the state after the completion of Task 8 implementation and before the execution of the newly modified context-update rule itself.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Correcting memory file format violations identified by `consolidate-repo`.
    - **Origin**: `consolidate-repo` -> `request-analysis`.
    - **Files to fix**:
        1.  `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`: Summary line (`‚úÖ‚ùå‚ÑπÔ∏è`) needs to be the first non-empty line.
        2.  `.cursor/memory-bank/context/projectBrief.md`: Needs to use H2 sections (`## Vision`, `## Objectives`, etc.) instead of H1 + bolded text.
    - **Guiding Rules**:
        - `test-execution.mdc` for `tests.md` format.
        - `context-loading.mdc` for `projectBrief.md` format.
- **Previous Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) were üü¢ DONE (before this corrective action).
- **Next Steps**: After these corrections, proceed to `context-update`.

*(Historical context is further condensed as all defined tasks are complete.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Outcome**: Successfully modified Step 5 of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts fail, the rule will now interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details. Steps 6-8 were made conditional on edit success.
- **Overall Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) are now üü¢ DONE.
- **Next Steps**: The workflow should now conclude.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (New Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Goal**: Change the behavior of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts (including full rewrite) fail, the rule should interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details and a code block for the changes.
    - **Key Changes to `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`**:
        - Modify Step 5's failure path (after "Full Rewrite" fails).
        - Instead of proceeding to Step 6 (Prepare to Return), it should:
            - Announce that all attempts failed and manual intervention is exceptionally required.
            - State the workflow is interrupted.
            - Provide a message like: "Dans le fichier `[target_file]`, veuillez effectuer les modifications suivantes :"
            - Include a single code block with high-level instructions for the manual edit (e.g., "Replace line X with Y", "Delete lines A-B").
        - Steps 6, 7, and 8 of the rule will likely not be reached in this failure scenario and might need to be implicitly or explicitly bypassed.
    - **Attention Points**: Ensure the language used for the user prompt is clear, emphasizes the exceptional nature, and provides all necessary information for the manual edit.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: ‚ö™Ô∏è **8. Enhance `context-update` to Comment on Archived Userbrief Tasks**
    - **Origin**: User request, processed through `consolidate-repo` and `task-decomposition`.
    - **Goal**: Modify `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc` to add a new step. This step should read `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`, identify archived tasks (üóÑÔ∏è), check `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md` for "memory" of processing these tasks, and if remembered, append `-> üß† [comment_text]` to the task in `userbrief.md`.
    - **Sub-Tasks to perform (from tasks.md)**:
        - ‚ö™Ô∏è **8.1. Design `context-update` New Step Logic**: Define insertion point, logic for reading files, parsing `userbrief.md`, memory check against `activeContext.md`, comment formatting, and editing `userbrief.md`.
        - ‚ö™Ô∏è **8.2. Implement `context-update` Modification**: Apply changes to `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`.
        - ‚ö™Ô∏è **8.3. Test Commenting Feature**: Manually prepare test files and verify correct commenting behavior.
    - **Logic for "remembering" a task**: The agent will be considered to "remember" an archived task if keywords from the task description in `userbrief.md` are found within relevant sections (e.g., "Current Focus", "Recent Decisions", "Completed Task" or similar narratives) of this `activeContext.md` file from previous states.
    - **Attention Points**: The new step in `context-update.mdc` must be inserted logically. The comment added should be concise and confirm processing. Ensure that only genuinely processed tasks (based on `activeContext.md` history) get comments.
