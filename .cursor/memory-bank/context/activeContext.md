# Active Context

## Current Goal
Prepare to implement the `cwd` argument for `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Extensive testing of MCP command execution.
- **Conclusion**: Testing completed successfully. The MCP server reliably executes commands and captures stdout/stderr/exit codes on Windows IF:
    1. Commands requiring bash are executed via explicit Git Bash invocation: `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "..."` (handled by `process_manager.js`)
    2. The bash command string includes `cd /path/to/workdir && ...` to ensure correct CWD.
    3. Inline scripts (e.g., `node -e`, `python -c`) are avoided due to quoting fragility; temporary files are preferred.
- **Tests Performed & Passed**: 
    - Python script file execution (stdout/stderr)
    - Non-zero exit code reporting
    - "Command not found" error reporting
- **Tests Failed (and confirmed known limitation)**:
    - Inline Python/Node script execution (due to quoting issues)

## Key Files Involved
- `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 2: Implement the `cwd` argument for `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
