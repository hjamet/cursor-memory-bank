# Active Context

## Current Goal
Commit changes for MCP server process tree killing and `experience-execution` rule update.

## Current implementation context
- **Task Completed**: 1.1 Implement Process Tree Killing
    - Added `fkill` dependency to `package.json`.
    - Installed dependencies.
    - Modified `lib/process_manager.js` to use `fkill(pid, { force: true, tree: true, ... })` instead of `process.kill`.
    - Verified with parent/child script test that killing parent terminates child.
- **Task Completed**: 2.1 Update experience-execution Rule
    - Modified `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc` instructions (Step 2) to detail incremental timeout strategy for monitoring long-running commands.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json`, `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`, `child_sleep.py` (test script), `parent_spawner.sh` (test script), `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (updated).
- **Status**: Implementation and testing complete for both tasks.
