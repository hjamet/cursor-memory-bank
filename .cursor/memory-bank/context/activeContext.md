# Active Context

## Current Focus
All planned tasks are complete. Awaiting new user requests.

## Recent Decisions
- **Userbrief System Refactored**: The userbrief management system has been successfully migrated from a Markdown-based approach to a structured JSON file (`userbrief.json`). This improves robustness, allows for unique ID tracking, and simplifies the logic of related MCP tools.
- **Test-Driven Development**: A dedicated test script (`tests/test_userbrief_json.js`) was created to validate the new userbrief system, ensuring the full lifecycle (creation, update, commenting, archiving) works as expected before deployment.

## Next Steps
1.  **Immediate**: Await new user requests to be added to `userbrief.json`.
2.  **Future**: Continue improving the agent's autonomy and capabilities based on new tasks.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`. The old `userbrief.md` has been deleted.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.

## Recent Learnings
- **JSON for State Management**: Using JSON with a clear schema is more reliable and maintainable for state management than parsing Markdown files.
- **Sequential Test Execution**: Ensuring tests that modify a shared state run sequentially is critical to avoid race conditions and get reliable results. Wrapping test runs in an async function with `await` is an effective pattern.
- **Proactive Code Refactoring**: It was necessary to add a new function (`addUserbriefRequest`) that was not in the original plan to enable proper testing. This highlights the need to be flexible and add necessary components during implementation.
