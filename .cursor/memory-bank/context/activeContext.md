# Active Context

## Current Goal
Consolidate repository state, process user feedback, and ensure system integrity before proceeding with implementation or fixing.

## Recent Actions
- Successfully refactored `process_manager.js` to use the `close` event for more reliable process termination and stream handling, removing the `setTimeout` hack.
- Attempted to run the `fix` rule, but found no failing tests in `tests.md`.
- Executed the `consolidate-repo` rule:
    - Reviewed `userbrief.md`, found only preferences (ðŸ“Œ), no new tasks.
    - Attempted integrity check (`find *.md`), but failed to get command output via MCP execute tool.
    - Cleaned up finished MCP terminal processes.
    - Added a task to `tasks.md` to investigate the MCP `find` command issue.
- Currently executing the `context-update` rule.

## Key Files Involved
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (Refactored)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (Read)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md` (Read)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` (Updated)
- `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md` (Updated)

## Potential Issues / Next Steps
- Investigate the MCP `find` command execution issue noted in `tasks.md`.
- Proceed with commit and determine the next rule based on tests/tasks.

## Current implementation context

- **Objective**: Resolve issues with async terminal MCP tools.
- **Last Task**: Fixed regression in `
