# Active Context

## Current Focus: ðŸŸ¢ Task 28 - Update on-edit-tool-fail Rule to Use Regex Edit Tool (COMPLETED)

### Task 28 Completion Summary
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully completed all objectives.
- **Outcome**: The `on-edit-tool-fail` rule has been enhanced to include the `regex_edit` tool as a new recovery strategy, providing a more robust and flexible mechanism for autonomous error correction during file edits.

### Upcoming Tasks Overview
- **Task 29**: Enhance recall tool with long-term memory database.

### Dependencies and Workflow
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Task 28 depends on Task 27 completion (âœ…)
- **Parallel Development**: Task 29 can be developed independently.

## Technical Implementation Status

### MemoryBank MCP Server Current State
- **Total Tools**: 10 tools (9 original + `remember` tool)
- **New Tools**: read_memory, edit_memory, remember (all fully functional)
- **Server Status**: âœ… Starts successfully with all tools registered
- **Registration Format**: âœ… Proper 3-parameter format maintained
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may require Cursor restart (documented issue)

### Memory Management Tools Specifications
- **read_memory**: Takes context_file enum, returns complete content with metadata
- **edit_memory**: Takes context_file enum + content, completely replaces existing content
- **remember**: Takes past, present, future strings and stores them in a capped JSON log.
- **File Path Mapping**: activeContext, projectBrief, techContext â†’ corresponding .md files
- **Error Handling**: Validates file names, handles missing files with clear suggestions

## Recent Achievements
- **Task 28**: âœ… `on-edit-tool-fail` rule successfully updated with new regex strategy.
- **Task 27**: âœ… `regex_edit` tool successfully implemented and added to MyMCP server.
- **Task 26**: âœ… MCP-based workflow system is functional.
- **Task 24**: âœ… All workflow rules successfully refactored to use MemoryBank MCP tools.
- **Task 23**: âœ… `remember` tool successfully implemented and tested.
- **Task 22**: âœ… Memory management tools successfully implemented and tested.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation documentation created.
- **Testing**: 100% success rate across all test scenarios.
- **Code Quality**: All files pass syntax validation and follow established patterns.
- **Integration**: Tools ready for use in workflow rule updates (Task 24).

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Proceed to Task 29 (Enhance Recall Tool with Long-term Memory).
2. **Future**: Explore further enhancements to the workflow and memory systems.

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`.
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP operational.
- **Tool Migration**: Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank.
- **Configuration**: `.cursor/mcp.json` properly configured for both servers.

## Recent Learnings
- **Rule Refactoring**: Large-scale refactoring of rules is possible and improves system architecture.
- **MCP Tool Development**: Established patterns for creating new MCP tools with proper error handling.
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suites validate all functionality before integration.
- **Client Discovery**: New tools may not appear immediately due to client-side caching.
- **Documentation Value**: Detailed documentation essential for complex implementations.
- **Modular Design**: Following established patterns ensures consistency and maintainability.
