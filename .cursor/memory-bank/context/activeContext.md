# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Previous Task:** 2.1 Add `send_terminal_input` MCP Tool (Implementation and Fix cycle complete)
- **Current Stage:** Context Update after Test Execution.
- **Goal:** Consolidate changes, check file integrity, and determine the next step in the workflow.

## Current Status

- **Completed Task 2.1:** Implementation of `send_terminal_input` in `server.js`.
- **Completed Fix Cycle:** Corrected regression in `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` by modifying the test command and the `execute_command` handler in `server.js`.
- **Test Execution Results:**
    - `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`: Passed (Verified Fix)
    - `tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`: Unknown (Execution Interrupted)
- **Completed Task 1.4:** Remove `[200~` Terminal Error Mentions.
- Completed `consolidate-repo` rule execution previously.
- Completed Task 3.1: Modify `stop_terminal_command` to accept a list of PIDs.

## Recent Decisions

- Corrected `execute_command` handler in `server.js` to properly pass command strings when `shell: true` is needed.
- Modified `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` to use a specific `echo` command.
- Implemented `send_terminal_input` tool cautiously in `server.js`.

## Next Steps

- Complete context update steps (cleanup, tasks.md, commit).
- Verify file integrity.
- Determine next rule based on test status (requires running interrupted test) and remaining tasks.

## Important Notes

- The status of the `send_terminal_input` test is still unknown and needs to be run again.
