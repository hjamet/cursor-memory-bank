# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- Completed Task: Modified `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` for concise output.
  - Reworked the 'statut' command output to use progress bars per task, italic status comments, and a final summary, removing verbose commentary.
  - Used rename-edit-rename workflow via `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
