# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Server Enhancements (In Progress)
- **Current Task:** 2.1 Add `send_terminal_input` MCP Tool (Validate Implementation & Test)
- **Goal:** Validate that the implementation of the `send_terminal_input` tool exists in `server.js` and ensure its associated test (`tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`) runs successfully, addressing any issues found in the test environment (ToDo Tasks 1.1 & 1.2).
- **Context:** The `tasks.md` indicates implementation was added but needs validation. The test environment itself needs fixing (ToDo Tasks 1.1, 1.2). The `workflow-perdu` interruption previously noted the tool was declared but not implemented; this needs re-verification.
- **Files:** `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`, `tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`

## Current Status

- **Completed Task 1.2:** Checked `.cursor/rules/test-execution.mdc`, confirmed up-to-date.
- Completed previous `context-update` cycle.
- **Completed Task 2.1 (Implementation):** Implemented `send_terminal_input` in `server.js`.
- **Completed Fix Cycle:** Fixed regression in `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
- **Current Test Status:**
    - `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`: Passed
    - `tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`: Unknown (Interrupted)

## Recent Decisions

- Identified Task 2.1 as the next priority based on `tasks.md`.
- Determined that the next step for Task 2.1 (a new feature) is to follow the workflow towards test execution.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with Task 2.1 validation within the `implementation` rule.
- Since this involves validating an existing (potentially modified) feature and its test, the next rule after successful validation/implementation will likely be `test-execution`.

## Important Notes

- The status of the test for `send_terminal_input` is currently unknown.
- Need to first verify if the implementation code for `send_terminal_input` exists in the current `server.js`.
- Strict adherence to the rule workflow even if it seems slightly redundant (calling `test-implementation` when the test exists) ensures process consistency.

## Lost workflow
- **Reason for interruption:** User requested MCP server tests and verification of `send_terminal_input` tool implementation, followed by triggering `workflow-perdu`.
- **Actions performed:**
    - Verified that `send_terminal_input` is declared in capabilities but not implemented in `server.js`.
    - Executed a series of tests using `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_output`, and `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` on the MCP server.
    - Tests included simple commands, long-running commands (ping), failing commands, output retrieval, and process termination/cleanup.
    - Confirmed successful operation of the implemented MCP tools.
- **Files/Symbols involved:** `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`, MCP tools (`mcp_MyMCP_*`)

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `tasks.md` (No updates mentioned in this interruption)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Last Modified Files:**
    - `.cursor/rules/implementation.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/consolidate-repo.mdc`
- **Key Functions/Classes:** MCP Server tools in `server.js`.

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A in this interruption.

## Documentation Context
- **Relevant Files:** Rules files (`*.mdc`), potentially `server.js` documentation if `send_terminal_input` were implemented.
- **Key Concepts:** MCP Server functionality, rule file updates.

## Workflow Interruption - New Chat
<SYSTEM>
Workflow interrupted by new-chat rule. If you are reading this and the user has just called the `system` rule, it means that you are in this new chat and that you must now resume the workflow where you left off. Exceptionally, you will be able to skip steps to resume directly to the next rule once you have finished reading your context files.
Resume from rule: implementation
Previous detailed context summary: The agent was about to execute the first instruction ('Task analysis') of the 'implementation' rule. This involved reading '.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md' to identify the priority task section (In Progress or ToDo). The agent had fetched the implementation rule and prepared the read_file call for tasks.md, but hadn't executed it yet.
