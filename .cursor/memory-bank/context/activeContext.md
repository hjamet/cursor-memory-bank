# Active Context

## Current Goal
Completed ad-hoc testing of the MCP command execution system.

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Tests**: Executed a series of tests covering basic commands, Python scripts, Git commands, long-running processes with timeouts, process interruption, special character handling, and subdirectory execution.
- **Summary**: The MCP command execution (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`, `get_terminal_status`, `get_terminal_output`, `stop_terminal_command`) is robust and handles various scenarios correctly. No regressions were found compared to existing tests.
- **Observations**:
    - `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`'s immediate response does not contain stdout/stderr, even for quickly finishing commands. Output must be retrieved via `get_terminal_status` or `get_terminal_output`. This differs from the description of the previously completed Task 3.1 in `tasks.md`.
    - `get_terminal_status` reports CWD as `.cursor`, while execution seems to happen from the project root. This is a minor reporting discrepancy.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (Added ad-hoc test results and observations)
- **Next Steps**: Commit documentation changes (`tests.md`) and check final workflow status.

## Lost workflow
- **Trigger**: User invoked `workflow-perdu.mdc`.
- **Last Actions**: Completed analysis of failing tests listed in `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`.
    - Confirmed `MCP Python Execution Test` now passes due to previous universal Git Bash execution fix in `process_manager.js`. Updated `tests.md` status to ✅.
    - Identified `MCP Async Terminal Workflow` test (`tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`) as invalid when run via MCP due to nested server conflict. Updated `tests.md` status to ⚠️ with explanation.
- **Files involved**: `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
- **Likely Workflow Phase**: Concluding the `fix` rule after analyzing and updating test statuses.
