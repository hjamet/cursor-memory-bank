# Active Context

## Current Goal
Commit changes for MCP server process tree killing and `experience-execution` rule update.

## Current implementation context
- **Task Completed**: 1.1 Implement Process Tree Killing
    - Added `fkill` dependency to `package.json`.
    - Installed dependencies.
    - Modified `lib/process_manager.js` to use `fkill(pid, { force: true, tree: true, ... })` instead of `process.kill`.
    - Verified with parent/child script test that killing parent terminates child.
- **Task Completed**: 2.1 Update experience-execution Rule
    - Modified `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc` instructions (Step 2) to detail incremental timeout strategy for monitoring long-running commands.
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/package.json`, `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`, `child_sleep.py` (test script), `parent_spawner.sh` (test script), `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md` (updated).
- **Status**: Implementation and testing complete for both tasks.

## Lost workflow - 2024-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+HH:MM

Investigation into reliably killing a process tree spawned by a bash script (`parent_spawner.sh`) running a Python script (`child_sleep.py`) in the background using `&` on Windows via Git Bash.

**Problem:** `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` fails to terminate the child Python process when the parent bash script PID is targeted.

**Files involved:**
- `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js` (specifically the `killProcess` function)
- `parent_spawner.sh` (test script)
- `child_sleep.py` (test script)

**Attempts:**
1.  **`fkill` (defaulting to `taskkill /T /F` on Windows):** Kills the parent bash process but leaves the child Python process running.
2.  **`wmic process where (ParentProcessId=<bash_pid>)`:** Failed to find the child Python process, likely due to the Git Bash environment creating a non-standard parent-child hierarchy. Also encountered initial execution issues requiring the full path `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\wmic.exe`.
3.  **`wmic process where "CommandLine like '%child_sleep.py%'"`:** Successfully found the Python process but couldn't reliably link it back to the specific parent bash script instance being stopped.

**Conclusion:** The standard process tree killing mechanisms (`taskkill /T`, `wmic ParentProcessId`) are insufficient for this specific setup on Windows/Git Bash. The child process appears orphaned or re-parented. A reliable solution might require changes to the MCP server's process tracking logic itself. The `process_manager.js` file was reverted to using the `fkill` implementation as a baseline.

**Next User Suggestion:** Try sending Ctrl+C (SIGINT) before attempting a forceful kill.
