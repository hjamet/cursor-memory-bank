# Active Context

## Completed Task: 🟢 9. Enhance `fix.mdc` Rule with Git Log Search for Mysterious Problems
- **Origin**: User request.
- **Outcome**: Modified `.cursor/rules/fix.mdc` (Step 2.2 Analysis and Example section). The rule now includes a step to perform a `git log --grep="<keywords>"` search when encountering "mysterious problems" (e.g., after 1-2 failed direct fix attempts, or for opaque errors). This helps leverage Git history for solutions. The Specifics section was also updated to mention this.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**:
    - 🟢 **9.1. Design and Implement `git log` Search Logic in `fix.mdc`**: Completed.
    - 🟢 **9.2. Update `fix.mdc` Example Section**: Completed.

## Completed Task: 🟢 10. Optimize Testing Logic in Rule System
- **Origin**: User request to improve the rule system's testing approach.
- **Outcome**: Successfully refactored the testing approach to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` over systematic automated test creation. This reduces test complexity and execution time while maintaining code quality through practical verification.
- **Key Changes Implemented**:
    1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Modified Step 5 to call `experience-execution` by default instead of `test-implementation` for testable features.
    2. **`experience-execution.mdc`**: Added temporary logging steps (Step 2: add logging, Step 7: remove if successful) and updated decision logic in Step 10 to optionally call `test-implementation` only when behaviors need to be "frozen".
    3. **`test-implementation.mdc`**: Restricted usage to "freezing" stable behaviors only. Updated TLDR, instructions, and specifics to emphasize very few tests, simple execution, focus on outputs not internal behavior, avoid mocks, stay close to real usage.
    4. **`test-execution.mdc`**: Reviewed and confirmed it works correctly in the new workflow where it's primarily called after `test-implementation`.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**:
    - 🟢 **10.1. Modify `implementation.mdc` Next Rule Logic**: Completed.
    - 🟢 **10.2. Enhance `experience-execution.mdc` with Temporary Logging**: Completed.
    - 🟢 **10.3. Update `experience-execution.mdc` Decision Logic**: Completed.
    - 🟢 **10.4. Restrict and Simplify `test-implementation.mdc`**: Completed.
    - 🟢 **10.5. Adjust `test-execution.mdc` for New Workflow**: Completed.
- **Technical Decisions**:
    - The new workflow prioritizes practical verification over comprehensive test coverage.
    - Temporary logging helps identify issues during manual execution.
    - Tests are only created for behaviors that are stable and unlikely to change.
    - Focus shifted from internal implementation testing to output verification.

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Enhanced `context-update` (Task 8) to add agent comments to archived `userbrief.md` tasks.
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7).
- Corrected memory file format violations (tests.md, projectBrief.md).

## Current implementation context
- All planned tasks from the current user request cycle are complete. Workflow is concluding.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: ⚪️ **8. Enhance `context-update` to Comment on Archived Userbrief Tasks**
    - **Origin**: User request, processed through `consolidate-repo` and `task-decomposition`.
    - **Goal**: Modify `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc` to add a new step. This step should read `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`, identify archived tasks (🗄️), check `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md` for "memory" of processing these tasks, and if remembered, append `-> 🧠 [comment_text]` to the task in `userbrief.md`.
    - **Sub-Tasks to perform (from tasks.md)**:
        - ⚪️ **8.1. Design `context-update` New Step Logic**: Define insertion point, logic for reading files, parsing `userbrief.md`, memory check against `activeContext.md`, comment formatting, and editing `userbrief.md`.
        - ⚪️ **8.2. Implement `context-update` Modification**: Apply changes to `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`.
        - ⚪️ **8.3. Test Commenting Feature**: Manually prepare test files and verify correct commenting behavior.
    - **Logic for "remembering" a task**: The agent will be considered to "remember" an archived task if keywords from the task description in `userbrief.md` are found within relevant sections (e.g., "Current Focus", "Recent Decisions", "Completed Task" or similar narratives) of this `activeContext.md` file from previous states.
    - **Attention Points**: The new step in `context-update.mdc` must be inserted logically. The comment added should be concise and confirm processing. Ensure that only genuinely processed tasks (based on `activeContext.md` history) get comments.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Correcting memory file format violations identified by `consolidate-repo`.
    - **Origin**: `consolidate-repo` -> `request-analysis`.
    - **Files to fix**:
        1.  `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`: Summary line (`✅❌ℹ️`) needs to be the first non-empty line.
        2.  `.cursor/memory-bank/context/projectBrief.md`: Needs to use H2 sections (`## Vision`, `## Objectives`, etc.) instead of H1 + bolded text.
    - **Guiding Rules**:
        - `test-execution.mdc` for `tests.md` format.
        - `context-loading.mdc` for `projectBrief.md` format.
- **Previous Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) were 🟢 DONE (before this corrective action).
- **Next Steps**: After these corrections, proceed to `context-update`.

*(Historical context is further condensed as all defined tasks are complete.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Completed Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Outcome**: Successfully modified Step 5 of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts fail, the rule will now interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details. Steps 6-8 were made conditional on edit success.
- **Overall Status**: All tasks in `tasks.md` (Tasks 1-7) are now 🟢 DONE.
- **Next Steps**: The workflow should now conclude.

*(Historical context is further condensed as all defined tasks are complete.)*

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: Modify `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (New Task 7)
    - **Origin**: User request.
    - **Goal**: Change the behavior of `.cursor/rules/on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`. If all automated edit attempts (including full rewrite) fail, the rule should interrupt the workflow and instruct the user to perform the edit manually, providing necessary details and a code block for the changes.
    - **Key Changes to `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc`**:
        - Modify Step 5's failure path (after "Full Rewrite" fails).
        - Instead of proceeding to Step 6 (Prepare to Return), it should:
            - Announce that all attempts failed and manual intervention is exceptionally required.
            - State the workflow is interrupted.
            - Provide a message like: "Dans le fichier `[target_file]`, veuillez effectuer les modifications suivantes :"
            - Include a single code block with high-level instructions for the manual edit (e.g., "Replace line X with Y", "Delete lines A-B").
        - Steps 6, 7, and 8 of the rule will likely not be reached in this failure scenario and might need to be implicitly or explicitly bypassed.
    - **Attention Points**: Ensure the language used for the user prompt is clear, emphasizes the exceptional nature, and provides all necessary information for the manual edit.

## Current implementation context
- **Current Task**: ⚪️ **10. Optimize Testing Logic in Rule System**
    - **Origin**: User request to improve the rule system's testing approach.
    - **Goal**: Refactor the testing approach to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` over systematic automated test creation. This aims to reduce test complexity and execution time while maintaining code quality through practical verification.
    - **Key Changes Required**:
        1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Modify Step 5 to call `experience-execution` by default instead of `test-implementation` for testable features.
        2. **`experience-execution.mdc`**: Add temporary logging steps (add at beginning, remove at end if successful) and modify decision logic to optionally call `test-implementation` only when behaviors need to be "frozen".
        3. **`test-implementation.mdc`**: Restrict usage to "freezing" stable behaviors only. Emphasize very few tests, simple execution, focus on outputs not internal behavior, avoid mocks, stay close to real usage.
        4. **`test-execution.mdc`**: Adjust to work correctly when called primarily after `test-implementation` rather than directly after `implementation`.
    - **Sub-Tasks to perform (from tasks.md)**:
        - ⚪️ **10.1. Modify `implementation.mdc` Next Rule Logic**: Update Step 5 calling logic.
        - ⚪️ **10.2. Enhance `experience-execution.mdc` with Temporary Logging**: Add logging steps.
        - ⚪️ **10.3. Update `experience-execution.mdc` Decision Logic**: Modify final decision logic.
        - ⚪️ **10.4. Restrict and Simplify `test-implementation.mdc`**: Update TLDR, instructions, specifics.
        - ⚪️ **10.5. Adjust `test-execution.mdc` for New Workflow**: Review and adjust for new workflow.
    - **Technical Decisions**:
        - The new workflow prioritizes practical verification over comprehensive test coverage.
        - Temporary logging should be added to help identify issues during manual execution.
        - Tests should only be created for behaviors that are stable and unlikely to change.
        - The focus shifts from internal implementation testing to output verification.
    - **Attention Points**: 
        - Ensure the workflow remains coherent and functional after changes.
        - Maintain the autonomous nature of the agent while improving efficiency.
        - Preserve the ability to detect and fix issues through the new approach.
