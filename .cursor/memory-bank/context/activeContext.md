# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Previous Task (Completed)**: Refactor Commit Message Generation across workflow rules.
    - **Outcome**: The `description` field for `mcp_MyMCP_commit` in rules `context-update.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, and `fix.mdc` now requires a highly verbose markdown format with sections for Changes, Testing, Observations, and a Conclusion. The standard is defined in `context-update.mdc`.
- **Completed Main Task**: Update Memory Bank File Formats & Integrate Templates (Task 2 from `tasks.md`).
    - **Outcome**: All memory bank files (`userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, `tests.md`) and context files (`projectBrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`) now have their formats and structural guidance defined directly within their primary managing rules. All corresponding template files in `.cursor/rules/templates/` have been deleted. Emoji-based status systems are implemented for `userbrief.md`, `tasks.md`, and `tests.md`.
    - **(Sub-tasks 2.1-2.5 details omitted for brevity, all completed)**
- **Completed Main Task**: Update General Rules for Consistency (Task 3 from `tasks.md`).
    - **Outcome**: Reviewed general workflow rules for compatibility with new memory file formats. 
        - Updated `.cursor/rules/system.mdc` to accurately reflect the memory bank file structure (including `userbrief.md`) and refine file descriptions.
        - Refactored `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` for simplicity, linearity, and to explicitly incorporate an archived user request regarding its operation (mandatory context gathering, French responses, handling of code modification requests by logging to `userbrief.md`).
- **Completed Main Task**: Fix MCP Commit Tool Multi-line Description (Task 5 from `tasks.md`).
    - **Completed Sub-Task (5.1)**: Investigate Commit Logs.
        - **Outcome**: Confirmed that multi-line commit descriptions were being truncated after the first line (e.g., "### Changes Made") in git logs.
    - **Completed Sub-Task (5.2)**: Implement Fix in `commit.js`.
        - **Outcome**: Modified `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/commit.js` to split multi-line descriptions into separate `-m` arguments for the `git commit` command, ensuring each paragraph is correctly passed.
    - **Completed Sub-Task (5.3)**: Test and Verify Fix.
        - **Outcome**: Successfully triggered a commit with a multi-line description via `context-update`. `git log -1 --pretty=format:%B` confirmed the entire multi-paragraph message was correctly recorded. The fix is verified.
    - **Next Steps**: Task 5 is ðŸŸ¢ DONE.

- **Current Task (Task 6 from `tasks.md`): Enhance MCP Commit Tool with Git Log Output**
    - **Sub-Task 6.1 (Implement `git log` Execution)**: ðŸŸ¢ DONE.
        - **Outcome**: Modified `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/commit.js` to execute the user-specified `git log` command (using bash explicitly) after a successful commit and append its output to the success message.
    - **Sub-Task 6.2 (Test and Verify Enhancement - In Progress)**: ðŸŸ¡ IN_PROGRESS
        - **Current Status**: The `git log` output is correctly appended. However, the prepended "Heure actuelle : DATE" string is not displaying the DATE correctly (shows "Heure actuelle : " followed by a newline, then the git log).
        - **Goal**: Modify `commit.js` to correctly generate and prepend the full "Heure actuelle : YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" string.
        - **Proposed Solution**: Generate the date string directly in JavaScript within `commit.js` instead of relying on `echo` and `date` shell command substitution, then prepend this to the `git log` output.
