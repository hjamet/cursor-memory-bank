# Active Context

**Current State:** Completed Implementation phase for Task 1.1 (Delete workflow-propositions.md). Moving to Context Update.

**Ongoing Task:** Update context files, tasks.md, verify integrity, and commit changes.

## Current implementation context
- **Tasks performed:**
    - Task 1.1: Deleted `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/workflow-propositions.md`.
- **Logic Applied:** Following user directive.
- **Relevant Info:** N/A
- **Attention Points:** N/A
- **Technical Decisions:** Used `delete_file` tool.

## Problèmes Résolus
- MCP memory integration tasks completed.

## Problèmes Persistants
- N/A

## Décisions Récentes
- [Current Date] - Completed modifications to `request-analysis.mdc`, `implementation.mdc`, and `fix.mdc`.
- [Current Date] - Decision to decompose the request into three distinct tasks, one for each rule modification.

## Prochaines Étapes
- Execute Task 2.1: Modify `implementation` rule for `terminal-mcp`.
- Execute Task 2.2: Modify `test-execution` rule for `terminal-mcp`.
- Execute Task 2.3: Update Command Execution Notes.
- Execute Task 12.1: Clean the tmp directory.

## Notes Importantes
The integration adds optional memory capabilities using MCP servers, enhancing the agent's context without altering the fundamental rule structures.

# Task 13: Workflow Improvement Proposals

**Objective:** Analyze the current workflow defined by the rules in `.cursor/rules/` and document thoughtful, non-trivial improvement proposals in a new file `workflow-propositions.md`.

**Plan:**
1.  **Execute Task 13.1:**
    *   Read and analyze each rule (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), paying attention to logic, state management, tool usage, and interactions.
    *   Focus on identifying potential enhancements beyond simple fixes (e.g., efficiency, robustness, user experience, error handling).
    *   Utilize a `<think>` block to structure the analysis and brainstorming.
2.  **Execute Task 13.2:**
    *   Synthesize the findings from the analysis.
    *   Create the file `workflow-propositions.md`.
    *   Write clear, actionable, and well-reasoned proposals into the new file.

**Current Step:** Starting Task 13.1 - Reading and analyzing rules.
