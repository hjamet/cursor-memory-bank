# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Integrate `commit` tool into rules.
- **Description**: Modified `fix.mdc` and `context-update.mdc` to use the new `commit` tool provided by the `mcp-commit-server`, replacing the direct `git commit` commands. This completes the integration task related to the MCP server functionality noted in `userbrief.md`.
- **Impacted Files**: `.cursor/rules/fix.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`, `.cursor/memory-bank/userbrief.md`.
- **Relevant Info**: The `mcp-commit-server` is now functional after correcting `server.js` initialization and `mcp.json` configuration. The `commit` tool requires structured input (emoji, type, message).
- **Attention Points**: Ensure commits made via rules now use the MCP tool.
- **Technical Decisions**: Standardized commit process across rules using the dedicated tool.

## Previous State Summary
- Verified `mcp-commit-server` functionality and `commit` tool availability.
- Corrected `.cursor/mcp.json` structure.
- Refactored `server.js` initialization in `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`.
- Simplified `fix` rule debugging logic.
- Completed Memory server update and Install script enhancement tasks.
- All tests passed.
