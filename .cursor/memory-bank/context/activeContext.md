# Active Context

## Lost workflow
I was in the process of executing a context-update rule, specifically step 4 (commit changes). I had just completed updating the activeContext.md file to reflect the completion of Task 19 (Fix Memory Bank MCP Server Tool Descriptions Compatibility Issue) and successfully committed the changes. The user then called the workflow-perdu rule, indicating I should restart the workflow properly.

Recent actions completed:
- Updated activeContext.md with Task 19 completion status
- Confirmed that MemoryBank MCP server was already correctly formatted
- Committed changes with comprehensive documentation
- Files involved: .cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/server.js, context files, validation results

## Current Implementation Context: Tasks 22-29 - Memory Management and Workflow System Redesign

### Current Focus: Task 22 - Implement Memory Management Tools for Context Files
- **Objective**: Create `read_memory` and `edit_memory` tools in MemoryBank MCP server for managing context files
- **Target Files**: activeContext.md, projectBrief.md, techContext.md
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Create read_memory.js tool - takes context file name, returns complete content
  2. Create edit_memory.js tool - takes context file name + content, completely replaces old content
  3. Register both tools in MemoryBank MCP server.js
  4. Implement error handling for non-existent files with directory creation
  5. Test tools with all three context files

### Technical Decisions for Task 22
- **File Path Resolution**: Use absolute paths based on project root for consistency
- **Error Handling**: Return clear error messages for missing files, offer to create with proper directory structure
- **Content Replacement**: edit_memory tool will completely overwrite existing content (not merge)
- **Validation**: Must preserve file integrity and handle edge cases gracefully

### Upcoming Tasks Context (Tasks 23-29)
- **Task 23**: Create remember tool for agent memory system (JSON-based, 100 entry limit)
- **Task 24**: Update all rules to use MemoryBank MCP tools instead of direct file operations
- **Task 25**: Create new branch "Memory Bank MCP" for development isolation
- **Task 26**: Complete workflow system redesign using MCP tools instead of .mdc rules
- **Task 27**: Add regex-based edit tool to MyMCP server as fallback
- **Task 28**: Update on-edit-tool-fail rule to use new regex tool
- **Task 29**: Enhance recall tool with long-term memory database

### Dependencies and Workflow
- **No Dependencies**: Task 22 can proceed immediately
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks 23-24 depend on Task 22 completion
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks 27-29 can be developed independently
- **Major Redesign**: Task 26 represents complete workflow system overhaul

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Implement tools one by one with testing
- **Code Reuse**: Study existing MemoryBank MCP tools for consistent patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file operations
- **Testing**: Validate each tool thoroughly before proceeding to next task

### Key Technical Considerations
- **File System Operations**: Ensure proper permissions and path handling
- **JSON Format**: For remember tool, design schema for past/present/future memory structure
- **MCP Integration**: Follow established patterns in MemoryBank server for tool registration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality while adding new tools

## Previous Completed Work Summary
- **Tasks 1-21**: All completed successfully
- **Latest Achievement**: Task 21 - Resolved MCP client discovery issue with comprehensive documentation
- **Current Server State**: MemoryBank MCP has 7 tools, MyMCP has 6 tools, both functional
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting guides created for MCP tool discovery issues

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on master, will need to create "Memory Bank MCP" branch for Task 25
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP servers operational and tested
- **Tool Migration**: Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank
- **Configuration**: .cursor/mcp.json properly configured for both servers

## Current Repository Status
- **All Major Tasks**: ✅ Completed (Tasks 19, 20, 21)
- **MCP Servers**: ✅ Both MemoryBank and MyMCP servers functional
- **Tool Migration**: ✅ Commit tool successfully migrated from MyMCP to MemoryBank
- **Client Discovery**: ✅ Issue resolved with documented solution
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting guides created

## Technical Implementation Status
- **MemoryBank MCP Server**: ✅ 7 tools (6 original + 1 commit tool) properly registered
- **MyMCP Server**: ✅ 6 tools (commit tool removed) functioning correctly
- **Tool Registration**: ✅ All tools use correct 3-parameter format
- **Server Startup**: ✅ Both servers start successfully (exit code 0)
- **Configuration**: ✅ `.cursor/mcp.json` properly configured

## Recent Achievements
- **Issue Resolution**: Successfully identified and documented MCP client discovery issue
- **Tool Migration**: Completed commit tool migration from MyMCP to MemoryBank MCP
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive troubleshooting guides for future reference
- **Prevention**: Established best practices for MCP server tool modifications
- **User Support**: Updated README.md with clear troubleshooting instructions

## Next Steps
- **User Action Required**: Restart Cursor application to see `mcp_MemoryBank_commit` tool
- **Workflow Status**: All current tasks completed successfully
- **Future Tasks**: Monitor for any additional user requests or issues
- **Documentation**: Maintain and update troubleshooting guides as needed

## Recent Learnings
- **MCP Client Behavior**: Cursor caches tool lists and requires restart for new tool discovery
- **Tool Migration**: Technical migration can be successful while client discovery requires additional steps
- **Documentation Value**: Comprehensive documentation prevents future similar issues
- **Testing Approach**: Server-side testing alone insufficient for full validation of tool availability
- **User Experience**: Client restart requirements should be clearly communicated to users

## Repository Status
- **Current State**: Task 20 completed - commit tool technically migrated successfully
- **Next Priority**: Task 21 implementation - resolve client discovery issue
- **File Structure**: All migration files in place and functional
- **Testing**: Ready for client discovery troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation Context
- **MemoryBank MCP Location**: `.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/`
- **Server Status**: ✅ Starts successfully with 7 tools (including commit)
- **Tool Count**: 6 original tools + 1 migrated commit tool
- **Registration Format**: ✅ Proper 3-parameter format maintained
- **Dependencies**: ✅ All imports and dependencies working correctly

## Previous Task Results
- **Task 20**: ✅ Commit tool migration technically complete
- **Migration Files**: ✅ All files created and configured correctly
- **Server Testing**: ✅ Both servers tested and working
- **Functionality**: ✅ MyMCP commit tool still works for validation

## Client Discovery Issue Context
- **Problem**: New tool not visible in Cursor interface despite successful server registration
- **Evidence**: Other MemoryBank tools work normally, indicating server connectivity
- **Scope**: Client-side discovery/caching issue rather than server-side problem
- **Impact**: Users cannot access migrated commit tool functionality

## Research Context
- **MCP Documentation**: Client discovery mechanisms and caching behavior
- **Forum Reports**: Multiple similar issues reported by Cursor users
- **Common Solutions**: Application restart most frequently mentioned
- **Best Practices**: Proper tool registration patterns and configuration management

## Repository Status
- **Current State**: All major tasks completed, server confirmed correctly formatted
- **Latest Analysis**: Task 19 comprehensive comparison completed with detailed documentation
- **File Structure**: Clean and well-organized with complete analysis report
- **Testing**: Server validated successfully with proper format confirmation

## Recent Learnings
- **Format Analysis**: Detailed comparison methodology established for MCP server troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis reporting provides valuable reference for future issues
- **User Issues**: Server format problems may not always be the root cause of user-reported issues
- **Validation**: Importance of thorough testing and documentation when investigating compatibility issues
