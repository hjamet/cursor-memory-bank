# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed**: Previous debugging tasks completed.
- **Test Results**: All tests passed.
- **Identified Issue**: The `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool definition available to the agent is missing the `bypass_hooks` argument, despite the backend implementation existing in `commit.js`. This prevents the agent from using the feature.
- **Limitation**: Agent cannot modify its own tool schema definitions. External update required.

## Summary of Recent Changes

- User requested update to `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool definition.
- Called `request-analysis`, identified the issue is with the agent's tool schema, which cannot be modified by the agent.
