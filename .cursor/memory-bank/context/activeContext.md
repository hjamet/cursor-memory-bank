# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** Rule Refactoring / MCP Integration
- **Current Task:** Modify rules (`context-update`, `consolidate-repo`, `experience-execution`, `request-analysis`, `fix`) to consistently use MCP tools for command execution (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` instead of `run_terminal_cmd` or direct commands like `find`, `rm`) and update `request-analysis` to recommend `mcp_Context7_*`.
- **Goal:** Ensure all rules adhere to the project standard of using MCP tools for external interactions and provide better guidance for library research.
- **Last Actions:** Completed `request-analysis` which identified the specific rules and modifications needed.
- **Files:** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (specifically those listed above)

## Current Status

- User confirmed MCP server stability and abandoned `mcp_send_input` development.
- Workflow restarted, `context-loading` and `consolidate-repo` completed.
- Analysis complete, ready for implementation.

## Recent Decisions

- Prioritize updating rules to use MCP tools based on user request/preferences.

## Next Steps

- Implement the identified changes to the rule files.
- Call `context-update` after modifications as these are non-testable rule edits.

## Important Notes

- Ensure MCP command syntax is correct (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command(command="...")`).
- Update rule descriptions and examples where necessary to reflect MCP tool usage.

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `tasks.md` (No dedicated tasks yet, working directly from analysis)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Files to Modify:**
    - `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/consolidate-repo.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/request-analysis.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/fix.mdc`
- **Key Functions/Classes:** N/A (Rule file text modifications)

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A
- **Relevant Tests:** N/A (Changes are to non-testable rule files)

## Documentation Context
- **Relevant Files:** Rules files (`*.mdc`)
- **Key Concepts:** MCP Tool usage (`mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`, `mcp_Context7_*`), Rule file structure.

## Lost workflow
- **Reason for interruption:** User requested MCP server tests and verification of `send_terminal_input` tool implementation, followed by triggering `workflow-perdu`.
- **Actions performed:**
    - Verified that `send_terminal_input` is declared in capabilities but not implemented in `server.js`.
    - Executed a series of tests using `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_output`, and `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` on the MCP server.
    - Tests included simple commands, long-running commands (ping), failing commands, output retrieval, and process termination/cleanup.
    - Confirmed successful operation of the implemented MCP tools.
- **Files/Symbols involved:** `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`, MCP tools (`mcp_MyMCP_*`)

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `tasks.md` (No updates mentioned in this interruption)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Last Modified Files:**
    - `.cursor/rules/implementation.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/consolidate-repo.mdc`
- **Key Functions/Classes:** MCP Server tools in `server.js`.

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A in this interruption.

## Documentation Context
- **Relevant Files:** Rules files (`*.mdc`), potentially `server.js` documentation if `send_terminal_input` were implemented.
- **Key Concepts:** MCP Server functionality, rule file updates.

## Workflow Interruption - New Chat
<SYSTEM>
Workflow interrupted by new-chat rule. If you are reading this and the user has just called the `system` rule, it means that you are in this new chat and that you must now resume the workflow where you left off. Exceptionally, you will be able to skip steps to resume directly to the next rule once you have finished reading your context files.
Resume from rule: implementation
Previous detailed context summary: The agent was about to execute the first instruction ('Task analysis') of the 'implementation' rule. This involved reading '.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md' to identify the priority task section (In Progress or ToDo). The agent had fetched the implementation rule and prepared the read_file call for tasks.md, but hadn't executed it yet.
