# Active Context

## Current Status
- **Last Action**: Completed `request-analysis` after `fix` rule handed over due to persistent test failures in `test_curl_install.sh`.
- **Outcome**: Analysis revealed the test failure was due to the test executing the *remote* `install.sh` (unmodified) while the local `install.sh` and test assertions *were* modified. Edits were correct but needed committing.
- **Next Step**: Commit the already performed local changes to `install.sh` and `tests/test_curl_install.sh`.

## Current Implementation Context
- **Task**: Resolve test failure by committing changes.
- **Goal**: Commit the fix for task 1.1 (absolute path in `install.sh` using `sed`) and the corresponding update to `tests/test_curl_install.sh` assertions.
- **Logic**:
    - Use the MCP Commit tool to commit the staged changes made during the previous `fix` cycle.
    - The changes include:
        - Modification in `install.sh` (`merge_mcp_json` function) to use `sed` for absolute path setting when `jq` is missing.
        - Modification in `tests/test_curl_install.sh` (`test_mcp_json_absolute_path_no_jq` function) to expect the `sed` success log and verify the path is absolute.
- **Impacted Files**: `install.sh`, `tests/test_curl_install.sh`
- **Dependencies**: Git, MCP Commit tool.
- **Decision**: Create a commit incorporating both the fix and the test update.
