# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Refactor MCP server test file locations and enhance MCP server testing capabilities.
- **Completed Task Group**: "1. Refactor Test File Locations" from `tasks.md` - All sub-tasks complete, tests moved and validated.
- **Completed Task Group**: "2. Enhance MCP Server Testing" from `tasks.md`.
  - Task 2.1: Python helper script `temp_python_script.py` created and refined.
  - Task 2.2: Test `test_python_interrupt.js` created and validated.
  - Task 2.3: Test `test_execute_command_long_timeout.js` created and validated (using `sleep` command).
- **All automated tests in `tests/mcp_server_tests/` are currently passing.**
- **Relevant Information**: User directive: Always use `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` for commands. Direct MCP server tests for timeout rejection (>5min) and Python script interruption were successful.
- **Attention Points**: The `persistent_child.sh` script showed unreliable sleep behavior in the MCP execution context; using simpler commands like `sleep` directly was more effective for testing long-running processes.
- **Dependencies**: None remaining for these completed tasks.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Workflow proceeded through `workflow-perdu`, `request-analysis`, `task-decomposition`, `implementation`, `test-execution`, and `fix` rules.
- Tasks for refactoring test locations were defined in `tasks.md`.
- Test files were moved to `tests/mcp_server_tests/` and paths updated.
- `__dirname` and script path issues in moved tests were resolved.
- All moved tests are confirmed passing.
