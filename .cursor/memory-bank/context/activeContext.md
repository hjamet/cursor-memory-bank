# Active Context

## Lost workflow
- Attempted to execute `task-decomposition` rule for the user request (modify `architect.mdc` and `experience-execution.mdc`).
- Encountered persistent errors when trying to modify `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md` (Step 3: Completed tasks removal & Step 4: New tasks integration).
- Multiple attempts (edit, reapply, rewrite, clear, prepend) failed to correctly update the file using the `edit_file` tool.
- Workflow interrupted due to inability to update `tasks.md`.
- Concerned files: `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tasks.md`, `.cursor/rules/custom/architect.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/custom/experience-execution.mdc`.

## Previous Context (Preserved)
- Workflow completed for the request to implement character-based log handling and fix related test regressions.
- Implemented character-based log retrieval in MCP tools (`logger.js`, tool handlers, `state_manager.js`).
- Verified functionality with ad-hoc tests.
- Fixed regression in `tests/test_consult_image.js` by updating assertion to expect `image/jpeg` (due to intended image processing).
- All automated tests (excluding known issue with `test_mcp_async_terminal.js` run via MCP) now pass.
- Fixed `consult_image` MCP tool (previously crashed on large images).
    - Used `sharp` library for server-side image resizing/compression before base64 encoding.
- Strengthened `experience-execution` rule analysis.
- Modified `experience-execution` rule error handling.
- Verified `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command`.
- Debugged `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error with `mcp-commit-server`.
