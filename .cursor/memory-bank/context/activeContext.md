# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Finalize workflow after successful modification of `architect.mdc`.
- **Current Task**: Update context files, commit changes, and check workflow status.
  - **Logic**: Update context, commit changes, check file integrity and tests/tasks status.
  - **Dependencies**: None.
  - **Attention Points**: Use MCP tools for commit and commands.

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Rule `.cursor/rules/architect.mdc` successfully modified to include a conditional workflow for handling user application modification requests. This involves:
  - Architect performs semantic searches.
  - Architect reads `userbrief.md`.
  - Architect re-reads `userbrief.md`.
  - Architect adds the request as a new task to `userbrief.md`'s "User Input" section, including image descriptions if necessary.
  - Architect does *not* implement the change directly.
- The `.mdc` -> `.md` -> edit -> `.mdc` workaround was used.
- Workflow proceeded through `context-loading`, `consolidate-repo`, `request-analysis`, and `implementation`.
- Previous `architect.mdc` creation and MCP commit server fixes are still relevant.
