# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Completed**: 
    1. Tested hook installation (`tests/test_install.sh` enhanced & passed).
    2. Documented manual hook verification steps in `README.md`.
    3. Added `bypass_hooks` argument to `mcp_MyMCP_commit` tool (`commit.js` modified).
    4. Modified `test-execution.mdc` rule with new `tests.md` format.
    5. Refactored `tests.md` to new format.
- **Test Results**: 
    - All automated tests passed, except `test_curl_install.sh` which failed as expected (404 fetching hook). 
    - No unexpected regressions.
    - Manual verification required for hook failure message display and `bypass_hooks` functionality.
