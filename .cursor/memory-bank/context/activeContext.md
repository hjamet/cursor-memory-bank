# Active Context

## Current Goal
Consolidate repository state after resolving MCP command execution issues.

## Current implementation context
- **Fixes Applied**:
    - Ensured `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` uses the project root as CWD on Windows by modifying `process_manager.js` to prepend `cd "${projectRoot}" &&` to the Windows bash command.
    - Resolved the 'Immediate Return (Early Completion Case)' failure by removing an unnecessary delay in `terminal_execution.js`, ensuring full output is returned immediately.
    - Fixed the `Reported CWD` issue by ensuring `terminal_execution.js` retrieves the CWD from state in the early completion case.
- **Result**: MCP command execution is now more reliable, correctly handling CWD on Windows, immediate output for early-completing commands, and reporting the correct CWD in responses.
- **Verification**: Confirmed fixes with direct MCP command tests (`pwd`, `cat`, `echo`). `tests.md` updated to reflect all tests passing (excluding known issue with `test_mcp_async_terminal.js`).
- **Files Involved**: `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/lib/process_manager.js`, `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/terminal_execution.js`, `.cursor/memory-bank/workflow/tests.md`, `.cursor/memory-bank/context/activeContext.md`.
- **Status**: All fixes implemented, validated, and committed.
- **Next Steps**: Final consolidation and workflow check.
