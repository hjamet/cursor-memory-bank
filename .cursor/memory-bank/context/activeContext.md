# Active Context

## Current Goal
Verify the fix for the MCP command stdout capture issue with Git Bash on Windows.

## Current implementation context
- **Task**: Investigate MCP command stdout issue
- **Problem**: Executing `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "<command>"` via `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` was resulting in successful execution (exit code 0) but empty stdout.
- **Fix Applied**: 
    1. Modified `process_manager.js` to explicitly spawn `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"` with `shell: false` and pass the command string via `-c` argument.
    2. Removed interfering `console.log`/`console.warn` statements from `process_manager.js`.
- **Tests Performed**: 
    - `echo 'test output'` (after fix): **Successful**. Stdout correctly captured as "test output\n".
- **Conclusion**: The combination of explicit spawning (`shell: false`) and removing console logs resolved the stdout capture issue for Git Bash commands via MCP on Windows.
- **Next Hypothesis**: The original `find` command should now also work.
