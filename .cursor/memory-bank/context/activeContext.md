# Active Context

## Current implementation context
- **Overall Goal**: Fix MCP commit server logic.
- **Current Task**: Modify `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/mcp_tools/commit.js`.
  - **Logic**: Refactor `handleCommit` to correctly determine commit success/failure based primarily on the `git commit` command's exit code, not just the presence of stderr output. Report success if exit code is 0, even with stderr warnings.
  - **Dependencies**: Relies on `execAsync` (likely from Node.js `child_process`) throwing an error for non-zero exit codes.
  - **Attention Points**: Ensure logic correctly handles 'nothing to commit' case and still retrieves committed files on success.
