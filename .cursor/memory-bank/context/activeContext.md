# Active Context

## Current Task: üü¢ 12. Create Memory Bank MCP Server - COMPLETED
- **Origin**: User request to create a second MCP server called "memory-bank-mcp" to simplify and streamline operations related to the rule system.
- **Status**: Successfully implemented and integrated
- **Key Achievements**:
    1. **Server Architecture**: Created complete MCP server structure inspired by MyMCP with modular design (server.js, lib/, mcp_tools/)
    2. **Core Tools Implemented**:
        - `read-userbrief`: Reads userbrief.md and returns current unprocessed/in-progress requests with configurable archived entries
        - `update-userbrief`: Updates userbrief entry status (mark in-progress, archived, add comments) with auto-detection
    3. **Integration**: Fully integrated into install.sh script with proper npm dependency management and mcp.json configuration
    4. **Testing**: Server starts correctly, tools function as expected, installation process validated

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Location**: `.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/`
- **Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, zod
- **Tools**: read-userbrief, update-userbrief
- **Configuration**: Added as "MemoryBankMCP" in mcp.json with node command
- **Installation**: Integrated in install.sh with curl and git clone support

## Next Steps
- Commit changes to repository for GitHub integration
- Test installation from remote repository
- Consider additional tools for rule system operations

## Previously Completed Task: üü¢ 11. Simplify Workflow Rules and Merge Request-Analysis with Task-Decomposition
- **Origin**: User request to simplify the rule system workflow.
- **Outcome**: Successfully streamlined the workflow by simplifying `implementation.mdc` decision logic and merging `request-analysis` functionality into `task-decomposition`. This reduces complexity and improves efficiency while maintaining all essential functionality.
- **Key Changes Implemented**:
    1. **`implementation.mdc`**: Simplified decision logic by moving all next rule calling exclusively to Step 5. Agent now completes all sub-tasks first, then decides between `experience-execution` (default) or `context-update` (rare cases with no executable code changes).
    2. **`task-decomposition.mdc`**: Enhanced with request analysis capabilities from the old `request-analysis.mdc`. Now handles both task decomposition AND initial request analysis in a single, more efficient rule.
    3. **Rule Cleanup**: Removed redundant `request-analysis.mdc` rule file to reduce system complexity.

## Implementation Context
- **Current Rule**: implementation.mdc - Step 4 (Active context update completed)
- **Next Action**: Call `experience-execution` rule to finalize the Memory Bank MCP Server implementation
- **Focus**: Memory Bank MCP Server creation and integration

    2. **`task-decomposition.mdc`**: Enhanced with comprehensive analysis capabilities including request analysis, code analysis with codebase search (max 3), research with Context7 tools or web search (max 5), and vision storage functionality. Removed tree creation step while preserving all existing task decomposition functionality.
    3. **Rule References**: Updated all references to `request-analysis` with `task-decomposition` in affected rules: `consolidate-repo.mdc`, `context-loading.mdc`, `fix.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, `system.mdc`, `workflow-perdu.mdc`, `new-chat.mdc`.
    4. **Cleanup**: Deleted obsolete `request-analysis.mdc` file after successful migration.
- **Sub-Tasks Status**:
    - üü¢ **11.1. Simplify `implementation.mdc` Decision Logic**: Completed.
    - üü¢ **11.2. Enhance `task-decomposition.mdc` with Analysis Capabilities**: Completed.
    - üü¢ **11.3. Update Rule References**: Completed.
    - üü¢ **11.4. Delete Obsolete `request-analysis.mdc`**: Completed.
- **Technical Decisions**:
    - Prioritized workflow simplicity and efficiency over granular separation of concerns.
    - Maintained the autonomous nature of the agent while reducing decision complexity.
    - Preserved all essential functionality including vision storage during the merge process.
    - Ensured workflow continuity by updating all rule references systematically.

## Previously Completed Work Context (Condensed)
- Optimized testing logic in rule system to prioritize manual execution via `experience-execution` (Task 10).
- Enhanced `fix.mdc` with Git log search for mysterious problems (Task 9).
- Enhanced `context-update` to add agent comments to archived `userbrief.md` tasks (Task 8).
- Modified `on-edit-tool-fail.mdc` for Manual Intervention on Exhausted Retries (Task 7).
- Completed major refactoring of memory bank file formats and commit message generation (Tasks 1-6).

## Current implementation context
**Active Task**: üü° Task 12. Create Memory Bank MCP Server

**Objective**: Create a second MCP server called "memory-bank-mcp" to simplify and streamline operations related to the rule system. The server will be inspired by the existing MyMCP server implementation and must be integrated into install.sh exactly like MyMCP.

**Key Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Analyze MyMCP server structure (`.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/`) to understand architecture patterns
- **Phase 2**: Create basic server structure with proper MCP SDK integration  
- **Phase 3**: Implement userbrief management tools: `read-userbrief` and `update-userbrief`
- **Phase 4**: Testing and integration into install.sh and mcp.json configuration

**Technical Research Insights**:
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) uses client-server architecture with tool registration
- MyMCP server uses modular structure: server.js (main), lib/ (utilities), mcp_tools/ (tool handlers)
- Tool registration follows MCP SDK patterns with zod schema validation
- Installation process includes dependency management and configuration in mcp.json

**Key Dependencies and Attention Points**:
- Must use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for proper MCP integration
- Follow MyMCP patterns for file structure and tool handler organization
- Userbrief.md format: emoji-based status system (üÜï, ‚è≥, üìå, üóÑÔ∏è)
- Integration with install.sh requires updating server list and configuration logic
- MCP.json configuration needs absolute paths for server script location

**Technical Decisions to Make**:
- Server naming convention: "MemoryBankMCP" vs "memory-bank-mcp" 
- Tool parameter structure for read-userbrief (number of archived items to return)
- Error handling strategy for userbrief.md file operations
- Testing approach: unit tests vs integration tests vs manual testing priority
