# Active Context

## Current Focus
Successfully resolved MCP server issues. Both MyMCP and MemoryBank MCP servers are now functioning correctly after fixing dependency and schema export problems.

## Recent Issues Resolved
- **MemoryBank MCP Server**: Fixed corrupted npm dependencies by complete reinstallation (missing dist folder in @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- **Missing Zod Schemas**: Added missing schema exports (commitSchema, editMemorySchema, readMemorySchema) with proper z imports
- **Server Validation**: Both servers now start without errors and pass timeout tests

## Current implementation context
-   **Repository State**: All MCP servers operational and validated
-   **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`
-   **Dependencies**: All npm packages properly installed with complete SDK builds

## Next Steps
1. Monitor MCP server stability in Cursor
2. Validate tool functionality through actual usage
3. Continue with any pending development tasks

## Repository Technical State
- **Branch**: Currently on `memory-bank-mcp`
- **Userbrief System**: Fully migrated to `userbrief.json`
- **MCP Servers**: Both MemoryBank and MyMCP fully operational and tested
- **Tool Schemas**: All tool argument descriptions properly exported and functioning
