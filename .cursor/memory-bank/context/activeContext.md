# Active Context

## Current implementation context

- **Task Group:** MCP Server Enhancements
- **Current Task:** 2.1 Add `send_terminal_input` MCP Tool (Verify Test Status)
- **Goal:** Determine the status of the test for the implemented `send_terminal_input` tool, as the previous execution was interrupted. This requires proceeding through the `implementation` -> `test-implementation` -> `test-execution` rule sequence.
- **Files:** `tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`
- **Current Implementation:** 3.4 Remove `[200~` Terminal Error Mentions
- **Goal:** Search all rule files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) for the obsolete warning note about the `[200~` terminal error and remove it. This note is no longer relevant with the new MCP tools.
- **Status:** Completed. All identified rule files (`consolidate-repo.mdc`, `context-update.mdc`, `experience-execution.mdc`, `implementation.mdc`) have been edited.

## Current Status

- **Completed Task 1.2:** Checked `.cursor/rules/test-execution.mdc`, confirmed up-to-date.
- Completed previous `context-update` cycle.
- **Completed Task 2.1 (Implementation):** Implemented `send_terminal_input` in `server.js`.
- **Completed Fix Cycle:** Fixed regression in `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`.
- **Current Test Status:**
    - `tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js`: Passed
    - `tests/test_mcp_send_input.js`: Unknown (Interrupted)

## Recent Decisions

- Identified Task 2.1 as the next priority based on `tasks.md`.
- Determined that the next step for Task 2.1 (a new feature) is to follow the workflow towards test execution.

## Next Steps

- Call `test-implementation` rule as dictated by the `implementation` rule for new testable features.

## Important Notes

- Strict adherence to the rule workflow even if it seems slightly redundant (calling `test-implementation` when the test exists) ensures process consistency.

## Lost workflow
- **Reason for interruption:** User requested MCP server tests and verification of `send_terminal_input` tool implementation, followed by triggering `workflow-perdu`.
- **Actions performed:**
    - Verified that `send_terminal_input` is declared in capabilities but not implemented in `server.js`.
    - Executed a series of tests using `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_status`, `mcp_MyMCP_get_terminal_output`, and `mcp_MyMCP_stop_terminal_command` on the MCP server.
    - Tests included simple commands, long-running commands (ping), failing commands, output retrieval, and process termination/cleanup.
    - Confirmed successful operation of the implemented MCP tools.
- **Files/Symbols involved:** `.cursor/mcp/mcp-commit-server/server.js`, MCP tools (`mcp_MyMCP_*`)

## Task List Context
- **Reference File:** `tasks.md` (No updates mentioned in this interruption)

## Code Implementation Context
- **Last Modified Files:**
    - `.cursor/rules/implementation.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/experience-execution.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/context-update.mdc`
    - `.cursor/rules/consolidate-repo.mdc`
- **Key Functions/Classes:** MCP Server tools in `server.js`.

## Test Context
- **Last Test Execution:** N/A in this interruption.

## Documentation Context
- **Relevant Files:** Rules files (`*.mdc`), potentially `server.js` documentation if `send_terminal_input` were implemented.
- **Key Concepts:** MCP Server functionality, rule file updates.
