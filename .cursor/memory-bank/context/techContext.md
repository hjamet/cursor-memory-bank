# Technical Context

## Project Overview
This project is an autonomous AI agent operating within the Cursor IDE. Its primary goal is to manage software development tasks, interact with the user via a Streamlit interface, and maintain a persistent memory of its operations.

## Core Technologies
- **AI Agent**: Custom-built agent running within Cursor IDE
- **Workflow Engine**: Rule-based system using `.mdc` files that dictate agent behavior
- **Memory System**: Custom "Memory Bank" for persistent state, tasks, and knowledge storage
- **MCP Tooling**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for system interactions
- **Frontend**: Streamlit application for user interaction and monitoring
- **Development**: Node.js (MCP servers), Python (Streamlit), Bash (installation)

## Architecture Overview

### Streamlit Application
The primary user interface for the agent, located in `.cursor/streamlit_app/`:

- **Main Entry Point**: `app.py` - Handles user request submission and task review with radio navigation
- **Components**:
  - `components/sidebar.py`: Centralized sidebar with auto-refresh, work queue counter, workflow step indicator, and clickable notification alerts with intelligent navigation
  - `components/task_utils.py`: Helper functions for task/user brief manipulation, workflow state tracking, and notification counting
  - `components/style_utils.py`: UI styling utilities
- **Pages**:
  - `pages/task_status.py`: Dashboard for viewing and tracking all tasks
  - `pages/memory.py`: Interface for inspecting agent's recent memories
- **Data Models**:
  - `tasks.json`: Development tasks with status history tracking
  - `userbrief.json`: User requests, decoupled from task management until conversion

### MCP Server Architecture

#### MemoryBankMCP Server (`mcp_MemoryBankMCP_*`)
Core server for agent state and workflow management:
- **User Request Management**: `read_userbrief`, `update_userbrief`
- **Task Management**: `create_task`, `update_task`, `get_all_tasks`, `get_next_tasks`
- **Version Control**: `commit` for standardized Git commits with refactoring task deduplication
- **Memory System**: `remember` for state recording, `next_rule` for workflow navigation with **critical loop prevention logic**

#### ToolsMCP Server (`mcp_ToolsMCP_*`)
System interaction server:
- **Terminal Operations**: `execute_command`, `get_terminal_status`, `get_terminal_output` (enhanced with `from_beginning` parameter), `stop_terminal_command`
- **Visual Processing**: `consult_image`, `take_webpage_screenshot`
- **File Manipulation**: `regex_edit` for precise file modifications with enhanced MCP communication

### Workflow System
Located in `.cursor/workflow-steps/`:
- **Autonomous Loop**: `start-workflow` â†’ `next_rule` â†’ `execute` â†’ `remember` â†’ repeat
- **Step Types**: `task-decomposition`, `implementation`, `fix`, `context-update`, `experience-execution`
- **Rule Files**: `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` (e.g., `start.mdc`)
- **Implementation Rule Enhancement**: The implementation rule has been refactored to guarantee systematic task marking as IN_PROGRESS at step 1, preventing task loss during transitions to experience-execution
- **Critical Loop Prevention**: The `remember` tool now includes sophisticated logic to prevent infinite loops, especially the critical experience-execution â†’ experience-execution transition
- **Experience-Execution Rule Hardening**: The experience-execution rule itself has been enhanced with mandatory anti-loop protections, ensuring tasks are marked REVIEW before any remember call

## Installation & Configuration

## Recent Enhancements

### Critical Workflow Loop Prevention (Latest)
- **Remember Tool Logic Fix**: Implemented comprehensive logic to prevent infinite loops in the autonomous workflow
  - **Core Problem Resolved**: The `remember` tool could incorrectly recommend `experience-execution` immediately after an `experience-execution` step, creating forbidden infinite loops
  - **New getRecommendedNextStep Function**: Added sophisticated routing logic that explicitly forbids experience-execution â†’ experience-execution transitions
  - **Smart State-Based Routing**: 
    - If task remains IN_PROGRESS after experience-execution â†’ routes to `fix` for issue resolution
    - If task is completed (no IN_PROGRESS) â†’ routes to `context-update` or `task-decomposition` (if new requests exist)
    - Preserves all other valid workflow transitions
  - **Comprehensive Validation**: Created and executed validation script with 6 critical tests, all passing
  - **Impact**: Eliminates the possibility of workflow infinite loops, ensuring robust autonomous operation

### Dependency System Enhancement (Latest)
- **Automatic Task Unblocking**: Comprehensive implementation of automatic dependency resolution system to prevent permanent task blocking
  - **Core Problem Resolved**: Tasks with dependencies were not automatically unblocked when their dependencies completed (REVIEW/DONE status), causing permanent workflow stalls
  - **New Functions Implemented**:
    - `areAllDependenciesCompleted()`: Validates completion status of all task dependencies
    - `checkAndUnblockDependentTasks()`: Automatically finds and unblocks tasks waiting on completed dependencies
    - `cleanupOrphanedDependencies()`: Removes dependencies to non-existent tasks to prevent permanent blocking
  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into `handleUpdateTask()` workflow for automatic triggering on task status changes
  - **Validation**: Comprehensive testing with multiple scenarios (simple dependency, multiple dependencies, orphaned dependencies) - all tests passed
  - **Impact**: Eliminates permanent task blocking in autonomous workflow, ensures smooth task progression without manual intervention
  - **File Modified**: `.cursor/mcp/memory-bank-mcp/mcp_tools/update_task.js`

### Experience-Execution Rule Enhancement (In Review)

  - **Visual Warnings**: Added ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEP warnings throughout the rule to prevent oversight
  - **Enhanced Examples**: Updated all examples to reflect the new mandatory sequence, ensuring consistent implementation
  - **Think Block Improvements**: Enhanced `<think>` sections with critical reminders about loop prevention requirements
  - **Architectural Impact**: This modification affects a core workflow file, providing double protection against infinite loops (remember tool + rule level)
  - **Impact**: Guarantees that experience-execution steps always mark tasks as REVIEW before calling remember, preventing any possibility of rule-level infinite loops

### ID Generation System Enhancement (In Review)
- **Robust ID Generation**: Comprehensive improvements to prevent duplicate ID issues that cause StreamlitDuplicateElementKey errors
  - **Enhanced create_task.js**: Added `generateUniqueTaskId()` function with collision detection, retry logic, and timestamp fallback

  - **Impact**: Resolves StreamlitDuplicateElementKey errors in client projects and ensures bulletproof ID generation system

### Workflow Rule Improvements
- **Implementation Rule Refactoring**: Major restructuring of the implementation workflow rule to guarantee systematic task marking
  - Step 1 renamed: "Task analysis" â†’ "Task analysis and status update"
  - Mandatory IN_PROGRESS marking: Tasks must be marked immediately upon identification at step 1
  - RULE #3 added: "MARQUER IMMÃ‰DIATEMENT la tÃ¢che comme IN_PROGRESS dÃ¨s l'Ã©tape 1 - AUCUNE EXCEPTION"
  - Enhanced anti-drift warnings: Explicit prohibitions against forgetting task marking
  - Updated example workflow: Reflects new process with systematic marking at step 1
  - **Impact**: Eliminates task loss during transitions to experience-execution, ensures robust workflow consistency

### Terminal Tools Improvements

  - Default mode: Incremental reading (only new output since last call)
  - `from_beginning: true`: Complete output from process start
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `TERMINAL_TOOLS_GUIDE.md` with usage patterns and troubleshooting
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with new optional parameters

### Commit Tool Enhancements
- **Refactoring Task Deduplication**: Automatic prevention of duplicate refactoring tasks for the same file
- **Smart Task Management**: Added `refactoring_target_file` field for precise task identification
- **Cleanup Logic**: Automatically removes existing refactoring tasks before creating new ones

### User Interface Improvements
- **Clickable Notification Indicator**: The red notification alert in the sidebar is now interactive, providing one-click navigation to the Review & Communication page with intelligent tab selection (Agent Messages prioritized over Tasks to Review)
- **Form Field Management**: Fixed text area clearing issue in the Add Request tab - form fields now properly reset after successful submission, preventing accidental duplicate submissions
- **Navigation Intelligence**: Implemented smart redirection logic that automatically opens the most relevant tab based on notification content

- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved UnboundLocalError in Streamlit UI validation system with improved robustness for legacy task data

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Tool Reliability
- **`edit_file` Instability**: Unreliable for large changes. Use `regex_edit` for precise modifications
- **Binary File Handling**: Standard tools cannot delete binary files; use terminal commands instead

### MCP Server Management
- **Tool Discovery**: New tools require full Cursor IDE restart to appear
- **Debug Logging**: Any non-JSON output breaks MCP communication
- **Server Restart**: Modify `mcp.json` temporarily to force server restart
- **Terminal Tools**: Enhanced tools require MCP server restart to activate new features
- **Tool Loading Inconsistency**: There is a suspected issue where the MCP server does not reliably load the latest version of tool files, even after a restart. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and make debugging extremely difficult.

### Development Practices
- **MDC File Editing**: Rename to `.md`, edit, rename back to `.mdc` for Git tracking
- **Memory Bank**: Automatic archive cleanup (50 max entries) prevents data bloat
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Warn on files >500 lines but don't block commits

### Workflow & Dependency Management
- **Dependency Logic**: The logic for resolving task dependencies is not functioning correctly, leading to workflow deadlocks. Tasks can remain blocked even when their dependencies are completed.

## Dependencies & Requirements

### Runtime Requirements
- **Cursor IDE**: Latest version for agent execution
- **Node.js**: v18+ for MCP servers
