# Test Results

## Installation Script Tests (2024-03-27)

### Command Line Interface
- ✅ **Help Flag Test**: Successfully displays usage information
- ✅ **Version Flag Test**: Successfully displays version information
- ✅ **Invalid Option Test**: Successfully displays error message for invalid options

### Installation Functionality
- ❌ **Directory Option Test**: Failed to create rules in specified directory
  - Expected: Directory structure `.cursor/rules` should be created in test directory
  - Actual: Directory not created
  - Note: This is expected as the core installation functionality is not yet implemented

### Summary
- Total Tests: 4
- Passed: 3
- Failed: 1

### Next Steps
The command-line interface is working correctly, but the core installation functionality needs to be implemented. This is not a regression as this is our first test run and the installation logic is still marked as TODO in the script.
