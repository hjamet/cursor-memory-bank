## Known Issues / Manual Tests
- ℹ️ **`test_git_install.sh` Auto-Config Path**: The automatic `git config core.hooksPath` logic added to `install.sh` was not tested in a Git repository context by `test_git_install.sh`. Manual verification or test enhancement needed to confirm successful auto-configuration.
