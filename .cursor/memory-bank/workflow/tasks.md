# In Progress

## 1. Fix Test Execution

1.1. [x] **Modify `test-execution` Rule**:
    - Description: Replace the failing `for ... bash` loop with individual execution of each test script (`tests/test_*.sh`). Capture individual exit codes and aggregate results.
    - Impacted Files: `.cursor/rules/test-execution.mdc`
    - Dependencies: None
    - Validation: The rule uses individual `bash <script>` commands and correctly determines overall success/failure.

1.2. [x] **Modify `fix` Rule**:
    - Description: Update the test execution step (2.5) to run only the specific test script being fixed (`bash tests/test_<name>.sh`), not the failing loop. Ensure it captures the exit code correctly.
    - Impacted Files: `.cursor/rules/fix.mdc`
    - Dependencies: None
    - Validation: The rule executes only the single relevant test script when attempting a fix.
