## Test: Fix `execute_command` Immediate Output

**Objective:** Verify that `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command` returns the *final* status and output immediately after the command finishes, instead of returning "Running".

**Method:**
1.  Run `node tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js` via `mcp_MyMCP_execute_command`.
2.  Check if the returned status is "Success" (or "Error") and if `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code` reflect the actual outcome.

**Execution (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS):
```sh
# Via mcp_MyMCP_execute_command with timeout=30
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "cd /c/Users/Jamet/code/cursor-memory-bank && node tests/test_mcp_async_terminal.js"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "pid": 20408,
  "cwd": "C:\\Users\\Jamet\\code\\cursor-memory-bank\\.cursor",
  "status": "Success",
  "exit_code": null,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": ""
}
```

**Analysis:**
*   **Success:** The command returned "Success", indicating the fix for waiting for completion worked.
*   **Failure:** The command did not execute in the correct directory (`cwd` is wrong). The `cd` command within `bash -c` was ineffective.
*   **Failure:** `exit_code` is `null` and `stdout`/`stderr` are empty, suggesting issues with capturing the final state accurately even though the status is "Success".

**Conclusion:** Partial success. The immediate status reporting is fixed, but the execution context and final state details are incorrect. Needs further investigation into how `spawn` handles `cwd` and captures exit details, especially when used with `bash -c`.

**Next Step:** Invoke `fix` rule to address the `cwd` and final state capture issues.
