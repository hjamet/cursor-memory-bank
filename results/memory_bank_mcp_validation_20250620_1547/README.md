## Test Results

### Server Startup Validation
| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Exit Code | 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Stdout Output | Contains "--- Test Suite Completed Successfully ---" | Contains "--- Test Suite Completed Successfully ---" | ✅ PASS |
| Stderr Output | Empty | Contains a warning about module type | ⚠️ WARN |

### Stderr Warning Analysis
The test produced the following warning:
```
(node:23304) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/hjamet/Code/cursor-memory-bank/tests/test_memory_bank_tools.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\\Users\\hjamet\\Code\\cursor-memory-bank\\package.json.
```
This is a project configuration recommendation and does not indicate a failure in the tools themselves. It should be addressed separately by updating `package.json`.

### Tool-by-Tool Analysis

A summary of the output for each tested tool. All tools behaved as expected.

*   **read-userbrief**: ✅ PASS. Correctly read the userbrief file.
*   **create_task**: ✅ PASS. Successfully created a new task and returned its ID.
*   **get_all_tasks**: ✅ PASS. Successfully retrieved all tasks.
*   **update_task**: ✅ PASS. Successfully updated the status of the created task.
*   **get_next_tasks**: ✅ PASS. Successfully retrieved the next available tasks.
*   **read_memory**: ✅ PASS. Successfully read the `activeContext.md` file.
*   **edit_memory**: ✅ PASS. Successfully edited and then reverted a change to `activeContext.md`.
*   **remember**: ✅ PASS. Successfully created a new memory entry.
*   **next_rule**: ✅ PASS. Successfully read a temporary dummy rule file.
*   **commit**: ⚠️ SKIPPED. This tool was not tested as it would create a real commit in the repository.

## Conclusion

The MemoryBank MCP tool suite is functionally correct and stable. The argument descriptions have been improved in `server.js`.

The initial issue reported by the user regarding `remember` and `next_rule` not showing arguments is highly likely to be a client-side caching issue in Cursor, as the tool definitions in the code are correct. A full restart of the Cursor application should resolve this for the user.
