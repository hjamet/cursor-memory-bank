# Streamlit UI for Task Management

A Streamlit application was created to provide a user interface for viewing task status.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `streamlit run src/main.py`

## Structure
- `src/main.py`: The main "Hello" page.
- `src/pages/task_status.py`: The page that displays task statuses from `src/tasks.json`.
- `src/tasks.json`: A sample file with tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the `streamlit` dependency.
